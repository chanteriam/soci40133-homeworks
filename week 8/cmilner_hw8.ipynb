        "# Week 8 - Conversation and Text Generation\n",
        "Many natural language activities boil down to text generation, especially the back-and-forth nature of natural conversation and question answering. While some may regard it as a parlour trick due to unpredictability, recent dramatic improvements in text generation suggest that these kind of models can find themselves being used in more serious social scientific applications, as in survey design and construction, idiomatic translation, and the normalization of phrase and sentence meanings.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Much recent NLP research is on text generation. Before the phenomenal product ChatGPT (OpenAI) was released at the end of 2022,  this is the primary use of large language models like GPT-3/4 (OpenAI), Wu Dao (Beijing Academy of AI), and Gopher (DeepMind). Then everything went wild in 2023. We saw tons of open-sourced LLMs were released like the Llama series (Meta), and how others techs wanted to compete with OpenAI by releasing models like Claude (Anthropic), Bard (Google), Gemini (Google x2), etc. The success of these models have prompted debate over whether the risks and perils of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is approaching!"

FINDINGS; PURPOSE. (a) Findings. Congress makes the following findings: (1) 49 percent of all pregnancies in America are unintended. Excluding miscarriages, 42 percent of unintended pregnancies end in abortion. (2) There are approximately 1,200,000 abortions annually in America and one in five pregnancies ends in abortion. (3) 57 percent of women who have abortions have incomes below 200 percent of the poverty level. (4) Rates of unintended pregnancy in the United States increased by nearly 30 percent among low income women between 1994 and 2001, and a low income woman today is about 4 times as likely to have an unintended pregnancy as her higher income counterpart. (5) Levels of contraceptive use among low income women at risk of unintended pregnancy declined significantly between 1994 and 2001, from 92 percent to 86 percent. (6) By helping couples avoid unintended pregnancy, Medicaid funded and title X contraceptive services are highly cost effective, and every public dollar spent on family planning saves 4 in the cost of pregnancy related care alone. (7) Abortion rates decreased among higher income women but increased among low income women between 1994 and 2001, and a low income woman is more than 4 times as likely to have an abortion as her higher income counterpart. (8) Most women cite more than one reason for their decision to have an abortion. The most frequently cited reasons were: having a baby would dramatically change my life'' (74 percent) by interfering with educational and job prospects and responsibilities towards existing children and cannot afford a baby now'' (73 percent). (b) Purpose. The purpose of this Act is to provide a comprehensive initiative to (1) reduce the need for abortion by reducing the number of unintended pregnancies and supporting women facing unplanned pregnancies; (2) prevent unintended pregnancies from occurring in the first place (A) by reducing teen pregnancy through comprehensive education, afterschool and other programs, and involving parents; and (B) by increasing support for family planning services under title X of the Public Health Service Act and extending Medicaid family planning services to more low income women and men; and (3) support pregnant women, new parents, and their children, through measures that address domestic violence and sexual assault, provide health care services, information about pregnancy, and other supportive services for pregnant women, and provide supportive services for new parents. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Act: (1) The term Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health and Human Services. (2) Except as specified, the term State'' includes the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern M ariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and any other territory or possession of the United States. SEC. 4. ELIGIBILITY OF INDIAN TRIBES FOR AWARDS. (a) In General. In the case of programs carried out pursuant to this Act that make awards of grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts, Indian tribes are eligible for awards under the programs in accordance with such criteria as the Secretary may establish. (b) Definitions. For purposes of this Act, the term Indian tribe'' has the meaning given such term in section 4 of the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U. S. C. 450b). TITLE I EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR PREVENTING TEEN PREGNANCIES SEC. 101. FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: (1) The United States has the highest teen pregnancy rate and teen birth rate among comparable countries, costing the United States at least 9,000,000,000 annually. (2) Three out of ten young women in America become pregnant before they reach the age of 20. (3) According to the National Center on Health Statistics, the teen birth rate increased 5 percent between 2005 and 2007, reversing a 14-year decline. Teen birth rates increased significantly in over half of states, representing nearly every region of the country. (4) Teen pregnancy has serious consequences for young parents, their children, and communities as a whole. Too early childbearing increases the likelihood that a young woman will drop out of high school and that she and her child will live in poverty. (5) Statistically, the sons of teen mothers are more likely to be incarcerated. The daughters of teen mothers are more likely to become teen mothers too. (6) Teens that grow up in disadvantaged economic, social, and family circumstances are more likely to engage in risky behavior and have a child during adolescence. (7) In a national survey on teen attitudes towards teen pregnancy, 7 in 10 girls and 6 in 10 boys report that they wish they had waited until they were older to have sex. (8) Programs comprehensive in scope are effective in reducing risk behaviors by delaying or reducing sexual activity, reducing the number of sexual partners or increasing condom or contraceptive use. Reducing risky behaviors leads to reductions in unintended pregnancy and abortion and transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV. (9) According to the results of a 2005-2006 nationally representative survey of U. S. adults, more than 8 of 10 of those polled support comprehensive education. (10) Ethnic and racial minority groups have been disproportionately affected by early pregnancy and parenthood. Fifty three percent of Lati na teens and 51 percent of African American young women will become pregnant at least once before they turn 20, as compared to only 19 percent of non Hispanic White young women. (11) Recent estimates suggest that while 15- to 24-year- olds represent 25 percent of the sexually active population, they acquire nearly half of all new S TIs. Each year, one in four sexually active teenagers contracts a sexually transmitted infection. (12) Nearly 15 percent of the 56,000 annual new cases of HIV infections in the United States occurred in youth ages 13 through 24 in 2006. An average of one young person every hour of every day is infected with HIV in the United States. (13) African American and Latino youth have been disproportionately affected by the HIV AIDS epidemic. Although African American adolescents ages 13 through 19 represent only 17 percent of the adolescent population in the United States, they accounted for 70 percent of new HIV AIDS cases reported among teens in 2005. Latino adolescents ages 13 through 19 accounted for 17 percent of AIDS cases among teens, the same as their proportion of the U. S. population in 2005. (14) Parental involvement is critical to any healthy relationship program. A major study showed that adolescents who reported feeling connected to parents and family were more likely than other teens to delay initiating sexual intercourse. Another study found that teens who reported previous discussions of sexuality with parents were seven times more likely to feel able to communicate with a partner about HIV AIDS than those who did not have such discussions with their parents. Parental involvement is a leading protective factor for dating violence prevention. (15) Comprehensive education programs respect the diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community and will complement and augment the education children receive from their families and faith communities. (16) Incorporating teen dating violence prevention into health education and comprehensive education is imperative given the widespread experience of violence in dating relationships. Approximately one in three teens reports some kind of abuse in a romantic relationship, including emotional and verbal abuse. Young women who experience dating violence have sex earlier than their peers; are much less likely to use birth control; and engage in a wide variety of high risk behaviors including multiple partners, sex with older men, and drug and alcohol abuse. Young women who are victims of dating violence are four to six times more likely than non abused girls to become pregnant. SEC. 102. EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR PREVENTING TEEN PREGNANCIES.

TITLE II REAUTHORIZATION OF CERTAIN AFTERSCHOOL PROGRAMS SEC. 201. FINDINGS. The Congress finds as follows: (1) The likelihood of teens having sex for the first time increases with the number of unsupervised hours teens have during a week. (2) Afterschool programs can reduce teen risky behavior. Teenage girls who play sports, for instance, are more likely to delay sex and have fewer partners and less likely to become pregnant. (3) Afterschool programs can help prevent teen pregnancy by advancing good decision making skills and providing teens with health education and positive role models in a supervised setting. SEC. 202.

Danforth\\nNo. 74-1151\\nArgued March 23, 1976\\nDecided July 1, 1976428 U.S. 52ast|>*\\n428 U.S. 52\\n\\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\\r\\nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI\\r\\nSyllabus \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTwo Missouri-licensed physicians, one of whom performs abortions at hospitals and the other of whom supervises abortions at Planned Parenthood, a not-for-profit corporation, brought suit, along with that organization, for injunctive and declaratory relief challenging the constitutionality of the Missouri abortion statute.  The provisions under attack are:  \\u00a7 2(2), defining \\\"viability\\\" as\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"that stage of fetal development when the life of the unborn child may be continued indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life supportive systems;\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u00a7 3(2), requiring that, before submitting to an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, a woman must consent in writing to the procedure and certify that \\\"her consent is informed and freely given, and is not the result of coercion\\\"; \\u00a7 3(3), requiring, for the same period, the written consent of the spouse of a woman seeking an abortion unless a licensed physician certifies that the abortion is necessary to preserve the mother's life; \\u00a7 3(4), requiring, for the same period, and with the same proviso, the written consent of a parent or person in loco parentis to the abortion of an unmarried woman under age 18; \\u00a7 6(1), requiring the physician to exercise professional care to preserve the fetus' life and health, failing which he is deemed guilty of manslaughter and is liable in an action for damages; \\u00a7 7, declaring an infant who survives an attempted abortion not performed to save the mother's life or health an abandoned ward of the State, and depriving the mother and a consenting father of parental rights; \\u00a7 9, prohibiting, after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, the abortion procedure of saline amniocentesis as \\\"deleterious to maternal health\\\"; and \\u00a7\\u00a7 10 and 11, prescribing reporting and recordkeeping \\nPage 428 U. S. 53\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t requirements for health facilities and physicians performing abortions.  The District Court ruled that the two physicians had \\\"obvious standing\\\" to maintain the suit, and that it was therefore unnecessary to determine if Planned Parenthood also had standing.  On the merits, the court upheld the foregoing provisions with the exception of \\u00a7 6(1)'s professional skill requirement, which was held to be \\\"unconstitutionally overbroad\\\" because it failed to exclude the pregnancy stage prior to viability.\\nHeld:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1. The physician appellants have standing to challenge the foregoing provisions of the Act with the exception of \\u00a7 7, the constitutionality of which the Court declines to decide.  Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179.  P.  428 U. S. 62, and n. 2.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2. The definition of viability in \\u00a7 2(2) does not conflict with the definition in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113,  410 U. S. 160,  410 U. S. 163, as the point at which the fetus is \\\"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid,\\\" and is presumably capable of \\\"meaningful life outside the mother's womb.\\\"  Section 2(2) maintains the flexibility of the term \\\"viability\\\" recognized in Roe.  It is not a proper legislative or judicial function to fix viability, which is essentially for the judgment of the responsible attending physician, at a specific point in the gestation period.  Pp.  428 U. S. 63-65.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t3. The consent provision in \\u00a7 3(2) is not unconstitutional.  The decision to abort is important and often stressful, and the awareness of the decision and its significance may be constitutionally assured by the State to the extent of requiring the woman's prior written consent.  Pp.  428 U. S. 65-67.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t4. The spousal consent provision in \\u00a7 3(3), which does not comport with the standards enunciated in Roe v. Wade, supra, at  410 U. S. 164-165, is unconstitutional, since the State cannot\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"'delegate to a spouse a veto power which the [S]tate itself is absolutely and totally prohibited from exercising during the first trimester of pregnancy.'\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPp.  428 U. S. 67-72.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t5. The State may not constitutionally impose a blanket parental consent requirement, such as \\u00a7 3(4), as a condition for an unmarried minor's abortion during the first 12 weeks of her pregnancy for substantially the same reasons as in the case of the spousal consent provision, there being no significant state interests, whether to safeguard the family unit and parental authority or other vise, in conditioning an abortion on the consent of a parent with respect to the under-18-year-old pregnant minor. As stressed in Roe, \\\"the abortion decision and its effectuation must \\nPage 428 U. S. 54\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.\\\"  410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 164.  Pp.  428 U. S. 72-75.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t6. Through \\u00a7 9, the State would prohibit the most commonly used abortion procedure in the country and one that is safer, with respect to maternal mortality, than even the continuation of pregnancy until normal childbirth, and would force pregnancy terminations by methods more dangerous to the woman's health than the method outlawed.  As so viewed (particularly since another safe technique, prostaglandin, is not yet available) the outright legislative proscription of saline amniocentesis fails as a reasonable protection of maternal health.  As an arbitrary regulation designed to prevent the vast majority of abortions after the first 12 weeks, it is plainly unconstitutional.  Pp.  428 U. S. 75-79.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t7. The reporting and recordkeeping requirements, which can be useful to the State's interest in protecting the health of its female citizens and which may be of medical value, are not constitutionally offensive in themselves, particularly in view of reasonable confidentiality and retention provisions.  They thus do not interfere with the abortion decision or the physician-patient relationship.  It is assumed that the provisions will not be administered in an unduly burdensome way, and that patients will not be required to execute spousal or parental consent forms in accordance with invalid provisions of the Act.  Pp.  428 U. S. 79-81.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t8. The first sentence of \\u00a7 6(1) impermissibly requires a physician to preserve the fetus' life and health, whatever the stage of pregnancy.  The second sentence, which provides for criminal and civil liability where a physician fails \\\"to take such measures to encourage or to sustain the life of the child, and the death of the child results,\\\" does not alter the duty imposed by the first sentence or limit that duty to pregnancies that have reached the stage of viability, and since it is inseparably tied to the first provision, the whole section is invalid.  Pp.  428 U. S. 81-84.\\n392 F.

JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis case is a logical and anticipated corollary to Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179 (1973), for it raises issues secondary to those that were then before the Court.  Indeed, some of the questions now presented were forecast and reserved in Roe and Doe.  410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 165 n. 67.\\nI\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAfter the decisions in Roe and Doe, this Court remanded for reconsideration a pending Missouri federal case in which the State's then-existing abortion legislation, \\nPage 428 U. S. 56\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Mo.Rev.Stat. \\u00a7\\u00a7 559.100, 542.380, and 563.300 (1969), was under constitutional challenge.  Rodgers v. Danforth, 410 U.S. 949 (1973).  A three-judge federal court for the Western District of Missouri, in an unreported decision, thereafter declared the challenged Missouri statutes unconstitutional and granted injunctive relief.  On appeal here, that judgment was summarily affirmed.  Danforth v. Rodgers, 414 U.S. 1035 (1973).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn June, 1974, somewhat more than a year after Roe and Doe had been decided, Missouri's 77th General Assembly, in its Second Regular Session, enacted House Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1211 (hereinafter Act).  The legislation was approved by the Governor on June 14, 1974, and became effective immediately by reason of an emergency clause contained in \\u00a7 A of the statute.  The Act is set forth in full as the 428 U.S. 52app|>Appendix to this opinion.  It imposes a structure for the control and regulation of abortions in Missouri during all stages of pregnancy.\\nII\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThree days after the Act became effective, the present litigation was instituted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.  The plaintiffs are Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri, a not-for-profit Missouri corporation which maintains a facility in Columbia, Mo., for the performance of abortions; David Hall, M.D.; and Michael Freiman, M.D.  Doctor Hall is a resident of Columbia, is licensed as a physician in Missouri, is chairman of the Department and Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Missouri Medical School at Columbia, and supervises abortions at the Planned Parenthood facility.  He was described by the three-judge court in the 1973 case as one of four plaintiffs who were \\\"eminent, Missouri-licensed obstetricians and gynecologists.\\\"  Jurisdictional \\nPage 428 U. S. 57\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Statement, App. 7, in Danforth v. Rodgers, No. 73-426, O.T. 1973.  Doctor Freiman is a resident of St. Louis, is licensed as a physician in Missouri, is an instructor of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology at Washington University Medical School, and performs abortions at two St. Louis hospitals and at a clinic in that city.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe named defendants are the Attorney General of Missouri and the Circuit Attorney of the city of St. Louis \\\"in his representative capacity\\\" and \\\"as the representative of the class of all similar Prosecuting Attorneys of the various counties of the State of Missouri.\\\"  Complaint 10.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe plaintiffs brought the action on their own behalf and, purportedly,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"on behalf of the entire class consisting of duly licensed physicians and surgeons presently performing or desiring to perform the termination of pregnancies and on behalf of the entire class consisting of their patients desiring the termination of pregnancy, all within the State of Missouri.\\\"\\nId. at 9.  Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and also sought to enjoin enforcement of the Act on the ground, among others, that certain of its provisions deprived them and their patients of various constitutional rights:  \\\"the right to privacy in the physician-patient relationship\\\"; the physicians' \\\"right to practice medicine according to the highest standards of medical practice\\\"; the female patients' right to determine whether to bear children; the patients' \\\"right to life due to the inherent risk involved in childbirth\\\" or in medical procedures alternative to abortion; the physicians' \\\"right to give and plaintiffs' patients' right to receive safe and adequate medical advice and treatment pertaining to the decision of whether to carry a given pregnancy to term and the method of termination\\\"; the patients' right under the Eighth Amendment to be free from cruel and unusual punishment \\\"by forcing \\nPage 428 U.

Supp. 1362 (1975).  The court ruled that the two physician plaintiffs had standing, inasmuch as \\u00a7 6(1) provides that the physician who fails to exercise the prescribed standard of professional care due the fetus in the abortion procedure shall be guilty of manslaughter, and \\u00a7 14 provides that any person who performs or aids in the performance of an abortion contrary to the provisions of the Act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.  392 F.

Due to this \\\"obvious standing\\\" of the two physicians, id. at 1367, the court deemed it unnecessary to determine whether Planned Parenthood also had standing.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the issues as to the constitutionality of the several challenged sections of the Act, the District Court, largely by a divided vote, ruled that all except the first sentence of \\u00a7 6(1) withstood the attack.  That sentence was held to be constitutionally impermissible because it imposed upon the physician the duty to exercise at all stages of pregnancy \\\"that degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus\\\" that \\\"would be required . . . to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born.\\\"  Inasmuch as this failed to exclude the stage of pregnancy prior to viability, the provision was \\\"unconstitutionally overbroad.\\\"  392 F. Supp.  at 1371.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOne judge concurred in part and dissented in part.  Id. at 1374.  He agreed with the majority as to the constitutionality of \\u00a7\\u00a7 2(2), 3(2), 10, and 11, respectively relating to the definition of \\\"viability,\\\" the woman's prior written consent, maintenance of records, \\nPage 428 U.

He dissented from the majority opinion upholding the constitutionality of \\u00a7\\u00a7 3(3), 3(4), 7, and 9, relating, respectively, to spousal consent, parental consent, the termination of parental rights, and the proscription of saline amniocentesis.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn No. 74-1151, the plaintiffs appeal from that part of the District Court's judgment upholding sections of the Act as constitutional and denying injunctive relief against their application and enforcement.  In No. 74-1419, the defendant Attorney General cross-appeals from that part of the judgment holding \\u00a7 6(1) unconstitutional and enjoining enforcement thereof.  We granted the plaintiffs' application for stay of enforcement of the Act pending appeal.  420 U.S. 918 (1975).

Wade, the Court concluded that the\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 153.  It emphatically rejected, however, the proffered argument\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"that the woman's right is absolute, and that she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way, and for whatever reason, she alone chooses.\\\"\\nIbid.  Instead, \\nPage 428 U. S. 61\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t this right \\\"must be considered against important state interests in regulation.\\\"  Id. at  410 U. S. 154.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Court went on to say that the \\\"pregnant woman cannot be isolated in her privacy,\\\" for she \\\"carries an embryo and, later, a fetus.\\\"  Id. at  410 U. S. 159.  It was therefore\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"reasonable and appropriate for a State to decide that, at some point in time, another interest, that of health of the mother or that of potential human life, becomes significantly involved.  The woman's privacy is no longer sole, and any right of privacy she possesses must be measured accordingly.\\\"\\nIbid.  The Court stressed the measure of the State's interest in \\\"the light of present medical knowledge.\\\"  Id. at  410 U. S. 163.  It concluded that the permissibility of state regulation was to be viewed in three stages:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician,\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twithout interference from the State.  Id. at  410 U. S. 164.  The participation by the attending physician in the abortion decision, and his responsibility in that decision, thus, were emphasized.  After the first stage, as so described, the State may, if it chooses, reasonably regulate the abortion procedure to preserve and protect maternal health.  Ibid.  Finally, for the stage subsequent to viability, a point purposefully left flexible for professional determination, and dependent upon developing medical skill and technical ability, [Footnote 1] the State may regulate an abortion to protect the life of the fetus and even may proscribe abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.  Id. at  410 U. S. 163-165. \\nPage 428 U. S. 62\\n\\nIV\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWith the exception specified in  n 2, infra, we agree with the District Court that the physician appellants clearly have standing.  This was established in Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 188.  Like the Georgia statutes challenged in that case,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"[t]he physician is the one against whom [the Missouri Act] directly operate[s] in the event he procures an abortion that does not meet the statutory exceptions and conditions.  The physician appellants, therefore, assert a sufficiently direct threat of personal detriment.  They should not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief. [Footnote 2]\\\"\\nIbid.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOur primary task, then, is to consider each of the \\nPage 428 U. S. 63\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t challenged provisions of the new Missouri abortion statute in the particular light of the opinions and decisions in Roe and in Doe.  To this we now turn, with the assistance of helpful briefs from both sides and from some of the amici.\\nA\\r\\nThe definition of viability.  Section 2(2) of the Act defines \\\"viability\\\" as\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"that stage of fetal development when the life of the unborn child may be continued indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life supportive systems.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAppellants claim that this definition violates and conflicts with the discussion of viability in our opinion in Roe.  410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 160,  410 U. S. 163.  In particular, appellants object to the failure of the definition to contain any reference to a gestational time period, to its failure to incorporate and reflect the three stages of pregnancy, to the presence of the word \\\"indefinitely,\\\" and to the extra burden of regulation imposed.  It is suggested that the definition expands the Court's definition of viability, as expressed in Roe, and amounts to a legislative determination of what is properly a matter for medical judgment.  It is said that the \\\"mere possibility of momentary survival is not the medical standard of viability.\\\"  Brief for Appellants 67.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Roe, we used the term \\\"viable,\\\" properly we thought, to signify the point at which the fetus is \\\"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid,\\\" and presumably capable of \\\"meaningful life outside the mother's womb,\\\" 410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 160,  410 U. S. 163.  We noted that this point \\\"is usually placed\\\" at about seven months or 28 weeks, but may occur earlier.  Id. at  410 U. S. 160.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe agree with the District Court, and conclude that the definition of viability in the Act does not conflict with what was said and held in Roe.  In fact, we believe that, \\nPage 428 U. S. 64\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\u00a7 2(2), even when read in conjunction with \\u00a7 5 (proscribing an abortion \\\"not necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother . . . unless the attending physician first certifies with reasonable medical certainty that the fetus is not viable\\\"), the constitutionality of which is not explicitly challenged here, reflects an attempt on the part of the Missouri General Assembly to comply with our observations and discussion in Roe relating to viability.  Appellant Hall, in his deposition, had no particular difficulty with the statutory definition. [Footnote 3]  As noted above, we recognized in Roe that viability was a matter of medical judgment, skill, and technical ability, and we preserved the flexibility of the term.  Section 2(2) does the same.  Indeed, one might argue, as the appellees do, that the presence of the statute's words \\\"continued indefinitely\\\" favor, rather than disfavor, the appellants, for, arguably, the point when life can be \\\"continued indefinitely outside the womb\\\" may well occur later in pregnancy than the point where the fetus is \\\"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb.\\\"  Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 160.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn any event, we agree with the District Court that it is not the proper function of the legislature or the courts to place viability, which essentially is a medical concept, at a specific point in the gestation period.  The time when viability is achieved may vary with each pregnancy, and the determination of whether a particular fetus is viable is, and must be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician.  The definition of viability in \\u00a7 2(2) merely reflects this fact.  The appellees do not contend otherwise, for they insist \\nPage 428 U. S. 65\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t that the determination of viability rests with the physician in the exercise of his professional judgment. [Footnote 4]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe thus do not accept appellants' contention that a specified number of weeks in pregnancy must be fixed by statute as the point of viability.  See Wolfe v. Schroering,\\u00a0388 F. Supp. 631, 637 (WD Ky.1974); Hodgson v. Anderson,\\u00a0378 F. Supp. 1008, 1016 (Minn.1974), dismissed for want of jurisdiction sub nom. Spannaus v. Hodgson, 420 U.S. 903 (1975). [Footnote 5]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe conclude that the definition in \\u00a7 2(2) of the Act does not circumvent the limitations on state regulation outlined in Roe.  We therefore hold that the Act's definition of \\\"viability\\\" comports with Roe and withstands the constitutional attack made upon it in this litigation.\\nB\\r\\nThe woman's consent.  Under \\u00a7 3(2) of the Act, a woman, prior to submitting to an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, must certify in writing her consent to the procedure and \\\"that her consent is informed and freely given, and is not the result of coercion.\\\"  Appellants argue that this requirement is violative of \\nPage 428 U. S. 66\\nRoe v. Wade,410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 164-165, by imposing an extra layer and burden of regulation on the abortion decision.  See Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 195-200.  Appellants also claim that the provision is overbroad and vague.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe District Court's majority relied on the propositions that the decision to terminate a pregnancy, of course, \\\"is often a stressful one,\\\" and that the consent requirement of \\u00a7 3(2) \\\"insures that the pregnant woman retains control over the discretions of her consulting physician.\\\"  392 F. Supp.  at 1368, 1369.  The majority also felt that the consent requirement \\\"does not single out the abortion procedure, but merely includes it within the category of medical operations for which consent is required.\\\" [Footnote 6]  Id. at 1369.  The third judge joined the majority in upholding \\u00a7 3(2), but added that the written consent requirement was \\\"not burdensome or chilling,\\\" and manifested \\\"a legitimate interest of the state that this important decision has in fact been made by the person constitutionally empowered to do so.\\\"  392 F. Supp.  at 1374.  He went on to observe that the requirement \\\"in no way interposes the state or third parties in the decisionmaking process.\\\"  Id. at 1375.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe do not disagree with the result reached by the District Court as to \\u00a7 3(2).  It is true that Doe and Roe clearly establish that the State may not restrict the decision of the patient and her physician regarding abortion during the first stage of pregnancy.  Despite the fact that apparently no other Missouri statute, with the exceptions referred to in  n 6, supra, requires a \\nPage 428 U. S. 67\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t patient's prior written consent to a surgical procedure, [Footnote 7] the imposition by \\u00a7 3(2) of such a requirement for termination of pregnancy even during the first stage, in our view, is not, in itself, an unconstitutional requirement.  The decision to abort, indeed, is an important and often a stressful one, and it is desirable and imperative that it be made with full knowledge of its nature and consequences.  The woman is the one primarily concerned, and her awareness of the decision and its significance may be assured, constitutionally, by the State to the extent of requiring her prior written consent.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe could not say that a requirement imposed by the State that a prior written consent for any surgery would be unconstitutional.  As a consequence, we see no constitutional defect in requiring it only for some types of surgery as, for example, an intracardiac procedure, or where the surgical risk is elevated above a specified mortality level, or, for that matter, for abortions. [Footnote 8]\\nC\\r\\nThe spouse's consent.  Section 3(3) requires the prior written consent of the spouse of the woman seeking an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, unless \\nPage 428 U. S. 68\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\\"the abortion is certified by a licensed physician to be necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother.\\\" [Footnote 9]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe appellees defend \\u00a7 3(3) on the ground that it was enacted in the light of the General Assembly's \\\"perception of marriage as an institution,\\\" Brief for Appellee Danforth 34, and that any major change in family status is a decision to be made jointly by the marriage partners.  Reference is made to an abortion's possible effect on the woman's childbearing potential.  It is said that marriage always has entailed some legislatively imposed limitations:  reference is made to adultery and bigamy as criminal offenses; to Missouri's general requirement, Mo.Rev.Stat. \\u00a7 453.030.3 (1969), that, for an adoption of a child born in wedlock, the consent of both parents is necessary; to similar joint consent requirements imposed by a number of States with respect to artificial insemination and the legitimacy of children so conceived; to the laws of two States requiring spousal consent for voluntary sterilization; and to the long-established requirement of spousal consent for the effective disposition of an interest in real property.  It is argued that\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"[r]ecognizing that the consent of both parties is generally necessary . . . to begin a family, the legislature has determined that a change in the family structure set in motion by mutual consent should be terminated only by mutual consent,\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBrief for Appellee Danforth 38, and that what the legislature did was to exercise its inherent policymaking power \\\"for what was believed to be in the best interests of all the people of Missouri.\\\"  Id. at 40.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe appellants, on the other hand, contend that \\u00a7 3(3) obviously is designed to afford the husband the right unilaterally to prevent or veto an abortion, whether or \\nPage 428 U. S. 69\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t not he is the father of the fetus, and that this not only violates Roe and Doe, but is also in conflict with other decided cases.  See, e.g., Poe v. Gerstein, 517 F.2d 787, 794-796 (CA5 1975), appeal docketed, No. 75-713; Wolfe v. Schroering, 388 F.Supp. at 636-637; Doe v. Rampton,\\u00a0366 F. Supp. 189, 193 (Utah 1973).  They also refer to the situation where the husband's consent cannot be obtained because he cannot be located.  And they assert that \\u00a7 3(3) is vague and overbroad.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Roe and Doe, we specifically reserved decision on the question whether a requirement for consent by the father of the fetus, by the spouse, or by the parents, or a parent, of an unmarried minor, may be constitutionally imposed.  410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 165 n. 67.  We now hold that the State may not constitutionally require the consent of the spouse, as is specified under \\u00a7 3(3) of the Missouri Act, as a condition for abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.  We thus agree with the dissenting judge in the present case, and with the courts whose decisions are cited above, that the State cannot\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"delegate to a spouse a veto power which the state itself is absolutely and totally prohibited from exercising during the first trimester of pregnancy.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t392 F. Supp.  at 1375.  Clearly, since the State cannot regulate or proscribe abortion during the first stage, when the physician and his patient make that decision, the State cannot delegate authority to any particular person, even the spouse, to prevent abortion during that same period.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe are not unaware of the deep and proper concern and interest that a devoted and protective husband has in his wife's pregnancy and in the growth and development of the fetus she is carrying.  Neither has this Court failed to appreciate the importance of the marital relationship in our society.  See, e.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479,  381 U. S. 486 (1965); Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. \\nPage 428 U. S. 70\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 190,  125 U. S. 211 (1888). [Footnote 10]  Moreover, we recognize that the decision whether to undergo or to forgo an abortion may have profound effects on the future of ay marriage, effects that are both physical and mental, and possibly deleterious.  Notwithstanding these factors, we cannot hold that the State has the constitutional authority to give the spouse unilaterally the ability to prohibit the wife from terminating her pregnancy when the State itself lacks that right.  See Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438,  405 U. S. 453 (1972). [Footnote 11] \\nPage 428 U. S. 71\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt seems manifest that, ideally, the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be one concurred in by both the wife and her husband.  No marriage my be viewed as harmonious or successful if the marriage partners are fundamentally divided on so important and vital an issue.  But it is difficult to believe that the goal of fostering mutuality and trust in a marriage, and of strengthening the marital relationship and the marriage institution, will be achieved by giving the husband a veto power exercisable for any reason whatsoever or for no reason at all.  Even if the State had the ability to delegate to the husband a power it itself could not exercise, it is not at all likely that such action would further, as the District Court majority phrased it, the \\\"interest of the state in protecting the mutuality of decisions vital to the marriage relationship.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t392 F. Supp.  at 1370.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe recognize, of course, that, when a woman, with the approval of her physician but without the approval of her husband, decides to terminate her pregnancy, it could be said that she is acting unilaterally.  The obvious fact is that, when the wife and the husband disagree on this decision, the view of only one of the two marriage partners can prevail.  Inasmuch as it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy, as between the two, the balance weighs in her favor.  Cf. Roe v Wade, 410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 153.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe conclude that \\u00a7 3(3) of the Missouri Act is inconsistent with the standards enunciated in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 164-165, and is unconstitutional.  It is therefore unnecessary for us to consider the appellants' \\nPage 428 U. S. 72\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t additional challenges to \\u00a7 3(3) based on vagueness and overbreadth.\\nD\\r\\nParental consent.  Section 3(4) requires, with respect to the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, where the woman is unmarried and under the age of 18 years, the written consent of a parent or person in loco parentis unless, again, \\\"the abortion is certified by a licensed physician as necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother.\\\"  It is to be observed that only one parent need consent.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe appellees defend the statute in several ways.  They point out that the law properly may subject minors to more stringent limitations than are permissible with respect to adults, and they cite, among other cases, Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158 (1944), and McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U. S. 528 (1971).  Missouri law, it is said, \\\"is replete with provisions reflecting the interest of the state in assuring the welfare of minors,\\\" citing statutes relating to a guardian ad litem for a court proceeding, to the care of delinquent and neglected children, to child labor, and to compulsory education.  Brief for Appellee Danforth 42.  Certain decisions are considered by the State to be outside the scope of a minor's ability to act in his own best interest or in the interest of the public, citing statutes proscribing the sale of firearms and deadly weapons to minors without parental consent, and other statutes relating to minors' exposure to certain types of literature, the purchase by pawnbrokers of property from minors, and the sale of cigarettes and alcoholic beverages to minors.  It is pointed out that the record contains testimony to the effect that children of tender years (even ages 10 and 11) have sought abortions.  Thus, a State's permitting a child to obtain an abortion without the counsel of an adult\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"who has responsibility \\nPage 428 U. S. 73\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t or concern for the child would constitute an irresponsible abdication of the State's duty to protect the welfare of minors.\\\"\\nId. at 44.  Parental discretion, too, has been protected from unwarranted or unreasonable interference from the State, citing Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 (1923); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 (1925); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205 (1972).  Finally, it is said that \\u00a7 3(4) imposes no additional burden on the physician, because, even prior to the passage of the Act, the physician would require parental consent before performing an abortion on a minor.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe appellants, in their turn, emphasize that no other Missouri statute specifically requires the additional consent of a minor's parent for medical or surgical treatment, and that, in Missouri, a minor legally may consent to medical services for pregnancy (excluding abortion), venereal disease, and drug abuse.  Mo.Rev.Stat. \\u00a7\\u00a7 431.061-431.063 (Supp. 1975).  The result of \\u00a7 3(4), it is said, \\\"is the ultimate supremacy of the parents' desires over those of the minor child, the pregnant patient.\\\"  Brief for Appellants 93.  It is noted that, in Missouri, a woman under the age of 18 who marries with parental consent does not require parental consent to abort, and yet her contemporary who has chosen not to marry must obtain parental approval.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe District Court majority recognized that, in contrast to \\u00a7 3(3), the State's interest in protecting the mutuality of a marriage relationship is not present with respect to \\u00a7 3(4).  It found \\\"a compelling basis,\\\" however, in the State's interest \\\"in safeguarding the authority of the family relationship.\\\"  392 F. Supp.  at 1370.  The dissenting judge observed that one could not seriously argue that a minor must submit to an abortion if her parents insist, and he could not see\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"why she would not be entitled to the same right of self-determination now \\nPage 428 U. S. 74\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t explicitly accorded to adult women, provided she is sufficiently mature to understand the procedure and to make an intelligent assessment of her circumstances with the advice of her physician.\\\"\\nId. at 1376.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOf course, much of what has been said above, with respect to \\u00a7 3(3) applies with equal force to \\u00a7 3(4).  Other courts that have considered the parental consent issue in the light of Roe and Doe, have concluded that a statute like \\u00a7 3(4) does not withstand constitutional scrutiny.  See, e.g., Poe v. Gerstein, 517 F.2d  at 792; Wolfe v. Schroering, 388 F.Supp. at 636-637; Doe v. Rampton, 366 F. Supp.  at 193, 199; State v. Koome,\\u00a084 Wash. 2d 901, 530 P.2d 260 (1975).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe agree with appellants and with the courts whose decisions have just been cited that the State may not impose a blanket provision, such as \\u00a7 3(4), requiring the consent of a parent or person in loco parentis as a condition for abortion of an unmarried minor during the first 12 weeks of her pregnancy.  Just as with the requirement of consent from the spouse, so here, the State does not have the constitutional authority to give a third party an absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto over the decision of the physician and his patient to terminate the patient's pregnancy, regardless of the reason for withholding the consent.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tConstitutional rights do not mature and come into being magically only when one attains the state-defined age of majority.  Minors, as well as adults, are protected by the Constitution, and possess constitutional rights.  See, e.g., Breed v. Jones, 421 U. S. 519 (1975); Goss v. Lopez, 419 U. S. 565 (1975); Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist., 393 U. S. 503 (1969); In re Gault, 387 U. S. 1 (1967).  The Court indeed, however, long has recognized that the State has somewhat broader authority to regulate the activities of children than of adults.  \\nPage 428 U. S. 75\\nPrince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. at  321 U. S. 170; Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629 (1968).  It remains, then, to examine whether there is any significant state interest in conditioning an abortion on the consent of a parent or person in loco parentis that is not present in the case of an adult.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOne suggested interest is the safeguarding of the family unit and of parental authority.  392 F. Supp.  at 1370.  It is difficult, however, to conclude that providing a parent with absolute power to overrule a determination, made by the physician and his minor patient, to terminate the patient's pregnancy will serve to strengthen the family unit.  Neither is it likely that such veto power will enhance parental authority or control where the minor and the nonconsenting parent are so fundamentally in conflict and the very existence of the pregnancy already has fractured the family structure.  Any independent interest the parent may have in the termination of the minor daughter's pregnancy is no more weighty than the right of privacy of the competent minor mature enough to have become pregnant.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe emphasize that our holding that \\u00a7 3(4) is invalid does not suggest that every minor, regardless of age or maturity, may give effective consent for termination of her pregnancy.  See Bellotti v. Baird, post, p.  428 U. S. 132.  The fault with \\u00a7 3(4) is that it imposes a special consent provision, exercisable by a person other than the woman and her physician, as a prerequisite to a minor's termination of her pregnancy, and does so without a sufficient justification for the restriction.  It violates the strictures of Roe and Doe.\\nE\\r\\nSaline amniocentesis.  Section 9 of the statute prohibits the use of saline amniocentesis, as a method or technique of abortion, after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.  \\nPage 428 U. S. 76\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t It describes the method as one whereby the amniotic fluid is withdrawn and \\\"a saline or other fluid\\\" is inserted into the amniotic sac.  The statute imposes this proscription on the ground that the technique \\\"is deleterious to maternal health,\\\" and places it in the form of a legislative finding.  Appellants challenge this provision on the ground that it operates to preclude virtually all abortions after the first trimester.  This is so, it is claimed, because a substantial percentage, in the neighborhood of 70% according to the testimony, of all abortions performed in the United States after the first trimester are effected through the procedure of saline amniocentesis.  Appellants stress the fact that the alternative methods of hysterotomy and hysterectomy are significantly more dangerous and critical for the woman than the saline technique; they also point out that the mortality rate for normal childbirth exceeds that where saline amniocentesis is employed.  Finally, appellants note that the perhaps safer alternative of prostaglandin instillation, suggested and strongly relied upon by the appellees, at least at the time of the trial, is not yet widely used in this country.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe held in Roe that, after the first stage,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 164.  The question with respect to \\u00a7 9 therefore is whether the flat prohibition of saline amniocentesis is a restriction which \\\"reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health.\\\"  Id. at  410 U. S. 163.  The appellees urge that what the Missouri General Assembly has done here is consistent with that guideline, and is buttressed by substantial supporting medical evidence in the record to which this Court should defer. \\nPage 428 U. S. 77\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe District Court's majority determined, on the basis of the evidence before it, that the maternal mortality rate in childbirth does, indeed, exceed the morality rate where saline amniocentesis is used.  Therefore, the majority acknowledged, \\u00a7 9 could be upheld only if there were safe alternative methods of inducing abortion after the first 12 weeks.  392 F. Supp.  at 1373.  Referring to such methods as hysterotomy, hysterectomy, \\\"mechanical means of inducing abortion,\\\" and prostaglandin injection, the majority said that at least the latter two techniques were safer than saline.  Consequently, the majority concluded, the restriction in \\u00a7 9 could be upheld as reasonably related to maternal health.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe feel that the majority, in reaching its conclusion, failed to appreciate and to consider several significant facts.  First, it did not recognize the prevalence, as the record conclusively demonstrates, of the use of saline amniocentesis as an accepted medical procedure in this country; the procedure, as noted above, is employed in a substantial majority (the testimony from both sides ranges from 68% to 80%) of all post-first-trimester abortions.  Second, it failed to recognize that, at the time of trial, there were severe limitations on the availability of the prostaglandin technique, which, although promising, was used only on an experimental basis until less than two years before.  See Wolfe v. Schroerin, 388 F. Supp.  at 637, where it was said that at that time (1974), there were \\\"no physicians in Kentucky competent in the technique of prostaglandin amnio infusion.\\\"  And appellees offered no evidence that prostaglandin abortions were available in Missouri. [Footnote 12]  Third, the statute's \\nPage 428 U. S. 78\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t reference to the insertion of \\\"a saline or other fluid\\\" appears to include within its proscription the intra-amniotic injection of prostaglandin itself, and other methods that may be developed in the future and that may prove highly effective and completely safe.  Finally, the majority did not consider the anomaly inherent in \\u00a7 9 when it proscribes the use of saline, but does not prohibit techniques that are many times more likely to result in maternal death.  See 392 F. Supp.  at 1378 n. 8 (dissenting opinion).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThese unappreciated or overlooked factors place the State's decision to bar use of the saline method in a completely different light.  The State, through \\u00a7 9, would prohibit the use of a method which the record shows is the one most commonly used nationally by physicians after the first trimester, and which is safer, with respect to maternal mortality, than even continuation of the pregnancy until normal childbirth.  Moreover, \\nPage 428 U. S. 79\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t as a practical matter, it forces a woman and her physician to terminate her pregnancy by methods more dangerous to her health than the method outlawed.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAs so viewed, particularly in the light of the present unavailability -- as demonstrated by the record -- of the prostaglandin technique, the outright legislative proscription of saline fails as a reasonable regulation for the protection of maternal health.  It comes into focus, instead, as an unreasonable or arbitrary regulation designed to inhibit, and having the effect of inhibiting, the vast majority of abortions after the first 12 weeks.  As such, it does not withstand constitutional challenge.  See Wolfe v. Schroering, 388 F. Supp.  at 637.\\nF\\r\\nRecordkeeping.  Sections 10 and 11 of the Act impose recordkeeping requirements for health facilities and physicians concerned with abortions irrespective of the pregnancy stage.  Under \\u00a7 10, each such facility and physician is to be supplied with forms\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"the purpose and function of which shall be the preservation of maternal health and life by adding to the sum of medical knowledge through the compilation of relevant maternal health and life data and to monitor all abortions performed to assure that they are done only under and in accordance with the provisions of the law.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe statute states that the information on the forms \\\"shall be confidential and shall be used only for statistical purposes.\\\"  The \\\"records, however, may be inspected and health data acquired by local, state, or national public health officers.\\\"  Under \\u00a7 11, the records are to be kept for seven years in the permanent files of the health facility where the abortion was performed.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAppellants object to these reporting and recordkeeping provisions on the ground that they, too, impose an extra \\nPage 428 U. S. 80\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t layer and burden of regulation, and that they apply throughout all stages of pregnancy.  All the judges of the District Court panel, however, viewed these provisions as statistical requirements \\\"essential to the advancement of medical knowledge,\\\" and as nothing that would \\\"restrict either the abortion decision itself or the exercise of medical judgment in performing an abortion.\\\"  392 F. Supp.  at 1374.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOne may concede that there are important and perhaps conflicting interests affected by recordkeeping requirements.  On the one hand, maintenance of records indeed may be helpful in developing information pertinent to the preservation of maternal health.  On the other hand, as we stated in Roe, during the first stage of pregnancy, the State may impose no restrictions or regulations governing the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician with respect to the termination of her pregnancy.  410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 163,  410 U. S. 164.  Furthermore, it is readily apparent that one reason for the recordkeeping requirement, namely, to assure that all abortions in Missouri are performed in accordance with the Act, fades somewhat into insignificance in view of our holding above as to spousal and parental consent requirements.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRecordkeeping and reporting requirements that are reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health and that properly respect a patient's confidentiality and privacy are permissible.  This surely is so for the period after the first stage of pregnancy, for then the State may enact substantive as well as recordkeeping regulations that are reasonable means of protecting maternal health.  As to the first stage, one may argue forcefully, as the appellants do, that the State should not be able to impose any recordkeeping requirements that significantly differ from those imposed with respect to other, \\nPage 428 U. S. 81\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t and comparable, medical or surgical procedures.  We conclude, however, that the provisions of \\u00a7\\u00a7 10 and 11, while perhaps approaching impermissible limits, are not constitutionally offensive in themselves.  Recordkeeping of this kind, if not abused or overdone, can be useful to the State's interest in protecting the health of its female citizens, and may be a resource that is relevant to decisions involving medical experience and judgment. [Footnote 13]  The added requirements for confidentiality, with the sole exception for public health officers, and for retention for seven years, a period not unreasonable in length, assist and persuade us in our determination of the constitutional limits.  As so regarded, we see no legally significant impact or consequence on the abortion decision or on the physician-patient relationship.  We naturally assume, furthermore, that these recordkeeping and record-maintaining provisions will be interpreted and enforced by Missouri's Division of Health in the light of our decision with respect to the Act's other provisions, and that, of course, they will not be utilized in such a way as to accomplish, through the sheer burden of recordkeeping detail, what we have held to be an otherwise unconstitutional restriction.  Obviously, the State may not require execution of spousal and parental consent forms that have been invalidated today.\\nG\\r\\nStandard of care.  Appellee Danforth in No. 74-1419 appeals from the unanimous decision of the District \\nPage 428 U. S. 82\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Court that \\u00a7 (1) of the Act is unconstitutional.  That section provides:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"No person who performs or induces an abortion shall fail to exercise that degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus which such person would be required to exercise in order to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born and not aborted.  Any physician or person assisting in the abortion who shall fail to take such measures to encourage or to sustain the life of the child, and the death of the child results, shall be deemed guilty of manslaughter. . . .  Further, such physician or other person shall be liable in an action for damages.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe District Court held that the first sentence was unconstitutionally overbroad because it failed to exclude from its reach the stage of pregnancy prior to viability.  392 F. Supp.  at 1371.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Attorney General argues that the District Court's interpretation is erroneous and unnecessary.  He claims that the first sentence of \\u00a7 6(1) establishes only the general standard of care that applies to the person who performs the abortion, and that the second sentence describes the circumstances when that standard of care applies, namely, when a live child results from the procedure.  Thus, the first sentence, it is said, despite its reference to the fetus, has no application until a live birth results.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe appellants, of course, agree with the District Court.  They take the position that \\u00a7 6(1) imposes its standard of care upon the person performing the abortion even though the procedure takes place before viability.  They argue that the statute, on its face, effectively precludes abortion, and was meant to do just that. \\nPage 428 U. S. 83\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe see nothing that requires federal court abstention on this issue.  Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U. S. 433,  400 U. S. 437-439 (1971); Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U. S. 51,5 414 U. S. 4-55 (1973).  And, like the three judges of the District Court, we are unable to accept the appellee's sophisticated interpretation of the statute.  Section 6(1) requires the physician to exercise the prescribed skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus.  It does not specify that such care need be taken only after the stage of viability has been reached.  As the provision now reads, it impermissibly requires the physician to preserve the life and health of the fetus, whatever the stage of pregnancy.  The fact that the second sentence of \\u00a7 6(1) refers to a criminal penalty where the physician fails \\\"to take such measures to encourage or to sustain the life of the child, and the death of the child results\\\" (emphasis supplied), simply does not modify the duty imposed by the previous sentence or limit that duty to pregnancies that have reached the stage of viability.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe appellees finally argue that, if the first sentence of \\u00a7 6(1) does not survive constitutional attack, the second sentence does, and, under the Act's severability provision, \\u00a7 B, is severable from the first.  The District Court's ruling of unconstitutionality, 392 F. Supp.  at 1371, made specific reference to the first sentence, but its conclusion of law and its judgment invalidated all of \\u00a7 6(1).  Id. at 1374; Jurisdictional Statement A-34 in No. 74-1419.  Appellee Danforth's motion to alter or amend the judgment, so far as the second sentence of \\u00a7 6(1) was concerned, was denied by the District Court.  Id. at A-39.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe conclude, as did the District Court, that \\u00a7 6(1) must stand or fall as a unit.  Its provisions are inextricably bound together.  And a physician's or other person's criminal failure to protect a live-born infant surely \\nPage 428 U. S. 84\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t will be subject to prosecution in Missouri under the State's criminal statutes.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe judgment of the District Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\nIt is so ordered.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t|428 U.S. 52app|\\nAPPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT\\r\\nH.

This section does much more than insure that the husband participate in the decision whether his wife should have an abortion.  The State, instead, has determined that the husband's interest in continuing the pregnancy of his wife always outweighs any interest on her part in terminating it, irrespective of the condition of their marriage.  The State, accordingly, has granted him the right to prevent unilaterally, and for whatever reason, the effectuation of his wife's and her physician's decision to terminate her pregnancy.  This state determination not only may discourage the consultation that might normally be expected to precede a major decision affecting the marital couple, but also, and more importantly, the State has interposed an absolute obstacle to a woman's decision that Roe held to be constitutionally protected from such interference.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Footnote 12]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn response to MR. JUSTICE WHITE's criticism that the prostaglandin method of inducing abortion was available in Missouri, either at the time the Act was passed or at the time of trial, we make the following observations.  First, there is no evidence in the record to which our Brother has pointed that demonstrates that the prostaglandin method was or is available in Missouri.  Second, the evidence presented to the District Court does not support such a view.  Until January, 1974, prostaglandin was used only on an experimental basis in a few medical centers.  And, at the time the Missouri General Assembly proscribed saline, the sole distributor of prostaglandin \\\"restricted sales to around twenty medical centers from coast to coast.\\\"  Brief for Appellee Danforth 68.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is clear, therefore, that, at the time the Missouri General Assembly passed the Act, prostaglandin was not available in any meaningful sense of that term.  Because of this undisputed fact, it was incumbent upon appellees to show that, at the time of trial in 1974, prostaglandin was available.  They failed to do so.  Indeed, appellees' expert witness, on whose testimony the dissenting opinion relies, does not fill this void.  He was able to state only that prostaglandin was used in a limited way until shortly before trial, and that he \\\"would think\\\" that it was more readily available at the time of trial.  Tr. 335.  Such an experimental and limited use of prostaglandin throughout the country does not make it available or accessible to concerned persons in Missouri.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Footnote 13]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe note that in Missouri physicians must participate in the reporting of births and deaths, Mo.Rev.Stat. \\u00a7\\u00a7 193.100 and 193.140 (1969), and communicable diseases, \\u00a7\\u00a7 192.020 and 192.040 (1969), and that their use of controlled substances is rigidly monitored by the State, \\u00a7\\u00a7 195.010-195.545 (1969 and Supp. 1975).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE POWELL joins, concurring.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhile joining the Court's opinion, I write separately to indicate my understanding of some of the constitutional issues raised by this litigation.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWith respect to the definition of viability in \\u00a7 2(2) of the Act, it seems to me that the critical consideration is that the statutory definition has almost no operative significance.  The State has merely required physicians performing abortions to certify that the fetus to be aborted is not viable.  While the physician may be punished for failing to issue a certification, he may not be punished for erroneously concluding that the fetus is not viable.  There is thus little chance that a physician's professional decision to perform an abortion will be \\\"chilled.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI agree with the Court that the patient consent provision in \\u00a7 3(2) is constitutional.  While \\u00a7 3(2) obviously regulates the abortion decision during all stages of pregnancy, including the first trimester, I do not believe it conflicts with the statement in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113,  410 U. S. 163, that,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"for the period of pregnancy prior to [approximately the end of the first trimester], the attending physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the State, that, in his medical judgment, the patient's pregnancy should be terminated.  If that decision is reached, the judgment \\nPage 428 U. S. 90\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t may be effectuated by an abortion free of interference by the State.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThat statement was made in the context of invalidating a state law aimed at thwarting a woman's decision to have an abortion.  It was not intended to preclude the State from enacting a provision aimed at ensuring that the abortion decision is made in a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary fashion.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAs to the provision of the law that requires a husband's consent to an abortion, \\u00a7 3(3), the primary issue that it raises is whether the State may constitutionally recognize and give effect to a right on his part to participate in the decision to abort a jointly conceived child.  This seems to me a rather more difficult problem than the Court acknowledges.  Previous decisions have recognized that a man's right to father children and enjoy the association of his offspring is a constitutionally protected freedom.  See Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535.  But the Court has recognized as well that the Constitution protects \\\"a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\\\"  Roe v. Wade, supra at  410 U. S. 153 (emphasis added).  In assessing the constitutional validity of \\u00a7 3(3), we are called upon to choose between these competing rights.  I agree with the Court that, since\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy . . . , the balance weighs in her favor.\\\"\\nAnte at  428 U. S. 71.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWith respect to the state law's requirement of parental consent, \\u00a7 3(4), I think it clear that its primary constitutional deficiency lies in its imposition of an absolute limitation on the minor's right to obtain an abortion.  The Court's opinion today in Bellotti v. Baird, post at  428 U. S. 147-148, suggests that a materially different constitutional issue would be presented under a provision requiring parental consent or consultation in most cases \\nPage 428 U. S. 91\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t but providing for prompt (i) judicial resolution of any disagreement between the parent and the minor, or (ii) judicial determination that the minor is mature enough to give an informed consent without parental concurrence or that abortion in any event is in the minor's best interest.  Such a provision would not impose parental approval as an absolute condition upon the minor's right, but would assure in most instances consultation between the parent and child. [Footnote 2/1]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThere can be little doubt that the State furthers a constitutionally permissible end by encouraging an unmarried pregnant minor to seek the help and advice of her parents in making the very important decision whether or not to bear a child.  That is a grave decision, and a girl of tender years, under emotional stress, may be ill-equipped to make it without mature advice and emotional support.  It seems unlikely that she will obtain adequate counsel and support from the attending physician at an abortion clinic, where abortions for pregnant minors frequently take place.

JUSTICE WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1073), this Court recognized a right to an abortion free from state prohibition.  The task of policing this limitation on state police power is and will be a difficult and continuing venture in substantive due process.  However, even accepting Roe v. Wade, there is nothing in the opinion in that case, and nothing articulated in the Court's opinion in this case, which justifies the invalidation of four provisions of House Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1211 (hereafter Act) enacted by the Missouri 77th General Assembly in 1974 in response to Roe v. Wade.  Accordingly, I dissent in part.\\nI\\nRoe v. Wade, supra at  410 U. S. 163, holds that, until a fetus becomes viable, the interest of the State in the life or potential life it represents is outweighed by the interest of the mother in choosing \\\"whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\\\"  410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 153.  Section 3(3) of the Act provides that a married woman may not obtain an abortion without her husband's consent.  The Court strikes down this statute in one sentence.  It says that,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"since the State cannot . . . proscribe abortion . . . the State cannot delegate authority to any particular person, \\nPage 428 U. S. 93\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t even the spouse, to prevent abortion. . . .\\\"\\nAnte at  428 U. S. 69.  But the State is not -- under \\u00a7 3(3) -- delegating to the husband the power to vindicate the State's interest in the future life of the fetus.  It is, instead, recognizing that the husband has an interest of his own in the life of the fetus which should not be extinguished by the unilateral decision of the wife. [Footnote 3/1]  It by no means follows, from the fact that the mother's interest in deciding \\\"whether or not to terminate her pregnancy\\\" outweighs the State's interest in the potential life of the fetus, that the husband's interest is also outweighed, and may not be protected by the State.  A father's interest in having a child -- perhaps his only child -- may be unmatched by any other interest in his life.  See Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645,  405 U. S. 651 (1972), and cases there cited.  It is truly surprising that the majority finds in the United States Constitution, as it must in order to justify the result it reaches, a rule that the State must assign a greater value to a mother's decision to cut off a potential human life by abortion than to a father's decision to let it mature into a live child.  Such a rule cannot be found there, nor can it be found in Roe v. Wade, supra.  These are matters which a State should be able to decide free from the suffocating power of the federal judge, purporting to act in the name of the Constitution. \\nPage 428 U. S. 94\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn describing the nature of a mother's interest in terminating a pregnancy, the Court in Roe v. Wade mentioned only the post-birth burdens of rearing a child, 410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 153, and rejected a rule based on her interest in controlling her own body during pregnancy.  Id. at  410 U. S. 154.  Missouri has a law which prevents a woman from putting a child up for adoption over her husband's objection, Mo.Rev.Stat. \\u00a7 453.030 (1969).  This law represents a judgment by the State that the mother's interest in avoiding the burdens of childrearing do not outweigh or snuff out the father's interest in participating in bringing up his own child.  That law is plainly valid, but no more so than \\u00a7 3(3) of the Act now before us, resting, as it does, on precisely the same judgment.\\nII\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSection 3(4) requires that an unmarried woman under 18 years of age obtain the consent of a parent or a person in loco parentis as a condition to an abortion.  Once again, the Court strikes the provision down in a sentence.  It states:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"Just as with the requirement of consent from the spouse, so here, the State does not have the constitutional authority to give a third party an absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto over the decision of the physician and his patient to terminate the patient's pregnancy. . . .\\\"\\nAnte at  428 U.

The Court rejects the notions that the State has an interest in strengthening the family unit, or that the parent has an \\\"independent interest\\\" in the abortion decision, sufficient to justify \\u00a7 3(4), and apparently concludes that the provision is therefore unconstitutional.  But the purpose of the parental consent requirement is not merely to vindicate any interest of the parent or of the State.  The purpose of the requirement is to vindicate the very right created in Roe v. Wade, supra -- the right of the pregnant woman to decide \\nPage 428 U. S. 95\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\\"whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\\\"  410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 13 (emphasis added).  The abortion decision is unquestionably important, and has irrevocable consequences whichever way it is made.  Missouri is entitled to protect the minor unmarried woman from making the decision in a way which is not in her own best interests, and it seeks to achieve this goal by requiring parental consultation and consent.  This is the traditional way by which States have sought to protect children from their own immature and improvident decisions, [Footnote 3/2] and there is absolutely no reason expressed by the majority why the State may not utilize that method here.\\nIII\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSection 9 of the Act prohibits abortion by the method known as saline amniocentesis -- a method used at the time the Act was passed for 70% of abortions performed after the first trimester.  Legislative history reveals that the Missouri Legislature viewed saline amniocentesis as far less safe a method of abortion than the so-called prostaglandin method.  The court below took evidence on the question and summarized it as follows:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"The record of trial discloses that use of the saline method exposes a woman to the danger of severe complications regardless of the skill of the physician or the precaution taken.  Saline may cause one or \\nPage 428 U. S. 96\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t more of he following conditions:  disseminated intravascular coagulation or 'consumptive coagulapathy' (disruption of the blood-clotting mechanism [Dr. Warren, Tr. 57-58; Dr. Klaus, Tr. 269-270; Dr. Anderson, Tr. 307; Defts.' Exs. H & M]), which may result in severe bleeding and possibly death (Dr. Warren, Tr. 58); hypernatremia (increase in blood sodium level), which may lead to convulsions and death (Dr. Klaus, Tr. 268); and water intoxication (accumulated water in the body tissue which may occur when oxytoxin is used in conjunction with the injection of saline), resulting in damage to the central nervous system or death (Dr. Warren, Tr. 76; Dr. Klaus, Tr. 270-271; Dr. Anderson, Tr. 310; Defts.' Ex. L).  There is also evidence that saline amniocentesis causes massive tissue destruction to the inside of the uterus (Dr. Anderson, Tr. 308).\\\"\\n392 F. Supp. 1362, 1372-1373 (1975).  The District Court also cited considerable evidence establishing that the prostaglandin method is safer.  In fact, the Chief of Obstetrics at Yale University, Dr. Anderson, suggested that \\\"physicians should be liable for malpractice if they chose saline over prostaglandin after having been given all the facts on both methods.\\\"  Id. at 1373.  The Court nevertheless reverses the decision of the District Court sustaining \\u00a7 9 against constitutional challenge.  It does so apparently because saline amniocentesis was widely used before the Act was passed; because the prostaglandin method was seldom used, and was not generally available; and because other abortion techniques more dangerous than saline amniocentesis were not banned.  At bottom, the majority's holding -- as well as the concurrence -- rests on its factual finding that the prostaglandin method is unavailable to the women of \\nPage 428 U. S. 97\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Missouri.  It therefore concludes that the ban on the saline method is\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"an unreasonable or arbitrary regulation designed to inhibit, and having the effect of inhibiting, the vast majority of abortions after the first 12 weeks,\\\"\\nante at  428 U. S. 79.  This factual finding was not made either by the majority or by the dissenting judge below.  Appellants have not argued that the record below supports such a finding.  In fact, the record below does not support such a finding.  There is no evidence in the record that women in Missouri will be unable to obtain abortions by the prostaglandin method.  What evidence there is in the record on this question supports the contrary conclusion. [Footnote 3/3]  The record discloses that the prostaglandin method of abortion was the country's second most common method of abortion during the second trimester, Tr. 42, 89-90; that, although the prostaglandin method had previously been available only on an experimental basis, it was, at the time of trial available in \\\"small hospitals all over the country,\\\" id. at 342; that, in another year or so, the prostaglandin method would become -- even in the absence of legislation on the subject -- the most prevalent method.  Anderson deposition at 69.  Moreover, one doctor quite sensibly testified that, if the saline method were banned, hospitals would quickly switch to the prostaglandin method.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe majority relies on the testimony of one doctor that -- as already noted -- prostaglandin had been available on an experimental basis only until January 1, 1974, and that its manufacturer, the Upjohn Co., restricted its sales to large medical centers for the following six months, after which sales were to be unrestricted.  Tr. \\nPage 428 U. S. 98\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 334, 335.  In what manner this evidence supports the proposition that prostaglandin is unavailable to the women of Missouri escapes me.  The statute involved in this litigation was passed on June 14, 1974; evidence was taken in July, 1974; the District Court's decree sustaining the ban on the saline method which this Court overturns was entered in January, 1975; and this Court declares the statute unconstitutional in July, 1976.  There is simply no evidence in the record that prostaglandin was or is unavailable at any time relevant to this case.  Without such evidence and without any factual finding by the court below, this Court cannot properly strike down a statute passed by one of the States.  Of course, there is no burden on a State to establish the constitutionality of one of its laws.  Absent proof of a fact essential to its unconstitutionality, the statute remains in effect.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe only other basis for its factual finding which the majority offers is a citation to another case -- Wolfe v. Schroerin,\\u00a0388 F. Supp. 631, 637 (WD Ky.1974) -- in which a different court concluded that the record in its case showed the prostaglandin method to be unavailable in another State -- Kentucky -- at another time -- two years ago.  This case must be decided on its own record.  I am not yet prepared to accept the notion that normal rules of law, procedure, and constitutional adjudication suddenly become irrelevant solely because a case touches on the subject of abortion.  The majority's finding of fact that women in Missouri will be unable to obtain abortions after the first trimester if the saline method is banned is wholly unjustifiable.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn any event, the point of \\u00a7 9 is to change the practice under which most abortions were performed under the saline amniocentesis method, and to make the safer prostaglandin method generally available.  It promises to \\nPage 428 U. S. 99\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t achieve that result if it remains operative, and the evidence discloses that the result is a desirable one, or at least that the legislature could have so viewed it.  That should end our inquiry, unless we purport to be not only the country's continuous constitutional convention but also its ex officio medical board with powers to approve or disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States.\\nIV\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSection 6(1) of the Act provides:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"No person who performs or induces an abortion shall fail to exercise that degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus which such person would be required to exercise in order to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born and not aborted.  Any physician or person assisting in the abortion who shall fail to take such measures to encourage or to sustain the life of the child, and the death of the child results, shall be deemed guilty of manslaughter. . . .  Further, such physician or other person shall be liable in an action for damages.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIf this section is read in any way other than through a microscope, it is plainly intended to require that, where a \\\"fetus [may have] the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb,\\\" Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. at  410 U. S. 163, the abortion be handled in a way which is designed to preserve that life notwithstanding the mother's desire to terminate it.  Indeed, even looked at through a microscope, the statute seems to go no further.  It requires a physician to exercise \\\"that degree of professional skill . . . to preserve the . . . fetus\\\" which he would be required to exercise if the mother wanted a live child.  Plainly, \\nPage 428 U. S. 100\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t if the pregnancy is to be terminated at a time when there is no chance of life outside the womb, a physician would not be required to exercise any care or skill to preserve the life of the fetus during abortion, no matter what the mother's desires.  The statute would appear then to operate only in the gray area after the fetus might be viable, but while the physician is still able to certify \\\"with reasonable medical certainty that the fetus is not viable.\\\"  See \\u00a7 5 of the Act, which flatly prohibits abortions absent such a certification.  Since the State has a compelling interest, sufficient to outweigh the mother's desire to kill the fetus, when the \\\"fetus . . . has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb,\\\" Roe v. Wade, supra, at  410 U. S. 163, the statute is constitutional.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIncredibly, the Court reads the statute instead to require \\\"the physician to preserve the life and health of the fetus, whatever the stage of pregnancy,\\\" ante at  428 U. S. 83, thereby attributing to the Missouri Legislature the strange intention of passing a statute with absolutely no chance of surviving constitutional challenge under Roe v. Wade, supra.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Court compounds its error by also striking down as unseverable the wholly unobjectionable requirement in the second sentence of \\u00a7 6(1) that, where an abortion produces a live child, steps must be taken to sustain its life.  It explains its result in two sentences:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"We conclude, as did the District Court, that \\u00a7 6(1) must stand or fall as a unit.  Its provisions are inextricably bound together.\\\"\\nAnte at  428 U. S. 83.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe question whether a constitutional provision of state law is severable from an unconstitutional provision is entirely a question of the intent of the state legislature.  There is not the slightest reason to suppose that the Missouri Legislature would not require proper care \\nPage 428 U. S. 101\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t for live babies just because it cannot require physicians performing abortions to take care to preserve the life of fetuses.  The Attorney General of Missouri has argued here that the only intent of \\u00a7 6(1) was to require physicians to support a live baby which resulted from an abortion.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAt worst, \\u00a7 6(1) is ambiguous on both points, and the District Court should be directed to abstain until a construction may be had from the state courts.  Under no circumstances should \\u00a7 6(1) be declared unconstitutional at this point. [Footnote 3/4]\\nV\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI join the judgment and opinion of the Court insofar as it upholds the other portions of the Act against constitutional challenge.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Footnote 3/1]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThere are countless situations in which the State prohibits conduct only when it is objected to by a private person most closely affected by it.  Thus, a State cannot forbid anyone to enter on private property with the owner's consent, but it may enact and enforce trespass laws against unauthorized entrances.  It cannot forbid transfer of property held in tenancy by the entireties, but it may require consent by both husband and wife to such a transfer.  These situations plainly do not involve delegations of legislative power to private parties; and neither does the requirement in \\u00a7 3(3) that a woman not deprive her husband of his future child without his consent.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Footnote 3/2]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAs MR.

If they should disagree with the majority's reading of state law on one or both of the points treated by the majority, the State could validly enforce the relevant parts of the statute -- at least against all those people not parties to this case.  Cf. Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479,  380 U. S. 492 (1965).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWith the exception of Parts IV-D and IV-E, I join the Court's opinion.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, the Court held that a woman's right to decide whether to abort a pregnancy is entitled to constitutional protection.  That decision, which is now part of our law, answers the question discussed in Part IV-E of the Court's opinion, but merely poses the question decided in Part IV-D.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIf two abortion procedures had been equally accessible to Missouri women, in my judgment, the United States Constitution would not prevent the state legislature \\nPage 428 U. S. 102\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t from outlawing the one it found to be less safe even though its conclusion might not reflect a unanimous consensus of informed medical opinion.  However, the record indicates that, when the Missouri statute was enacted, a prohibition of the saline amniocentesis procedure was almost tantamount to a prohibition of any abortion in the State after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Such a prohibition is inconsistent with the essential holding of Roe v. Wade, and therefore cannot stand.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn my opinion, however, the parental consent requirement is consistent with the holding in Roe.  The State's interest in the welfare of its young citizens justifies a variety of protective measures.  Because he may not foresee the consequences of his decision, a minor may not make an enforceable bargain.  He may not lawfully work or travel where he pleases, or even attend exhibitions of constitutionally protected adult motion pictures.  Persons below a certain age may not marry without parental consent.  Indeed, such consent is essential even when the young woman is already pregnant.  The State's interest in protecting a young person from harm justifies the imposition of restraints on his or her freedom even though comparable restraints on adults would be constitutionally impermissible.  Therefore, the holding in Roe v. Wade that the abortion decision is entitled to constitutional protection merely emphasizes the importance of the decision; it does not lead to the conclusion that the state legislature has no power to enact legislation for the purpose of protecting a young pregnant woman from the consequences of an incorrect decision.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe abortion decision is, of course, more important than the decision to attend or to avoid an adult motion picture, or the decision to work long hours in a \\nPage 428 U. S. 103\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t factory.  It is not necessarily any more important than the decision to run away from home or the decision to marry.  But even if it is the most important kind of a decision a young person may ever make, that assumption merely enhances the quality of the State's interest in maximizing the probability that the decision be made correctly, and with full understanding of the consequences of either alternative.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Court recognizes that the State may insist that the decision not be made without the benefit of medical advice.  But since the most significant consequences of the decision are not medical in character, it would seem to me that the State may, with equal legitimacy, insist that the decision be made only after other appropriate counsel has been had as well.  Whatever choice a pregnant young woman makes -- to marry, to abort, to bear her child out of wedlock -- the consequences of her decision may have a profound impact on her entire future life.  A legislative determination that such a choice will be made more wisely in most cases if the advice and moral support of a parent play a part in the decisionmaking process is surely not irrational.  Moreover, it is perfectly clear that the parental consent requirement will necessarily involve a parent in the decisional process.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIf there is no parental consent requirement, many minors will submit to the abortion procedure without ever informing their parents.  An assumption that the parental reaction will be hostile, disparaging, or violent no doubt persuades many children simply to bypass parental counsel which would, in fact, be loving, supportive, and, indeed, for some indispensable.  It is unrealistic, in my judgment, to assume that every parent-child relationship is either (a) so perfect that communication and accord will take place routinely or \\nPage 428 U. S. 104\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t (b) so imperfect that the absence of communication reflects the child's correct prediction that the parent will exercise his or her veto arbitrarily to further a selfish interest, rather than the child's interest.  A state legislature may conclude that most parents will be primarily interested in the welfare of their children, and further, that the imposition of a parental consent requirement is an appropriate method of giving the parents an opportunity to foster that welfare by helping a pregnant distressed child to make and to implement a correct decision.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe State's interest is not dependent on an estimate of the impact the parental consent requirement may have on the total number of abortions that may take place.  I assume that parents will sometimes prevent abortions which might better be performed; other parents may advise abortions that should not be performed.  Similarly, even doctors are not omniscient; specialists in performing abortions may incorrectly conclude that the immediate advantages of the procedure outweigh the disadvantages which a parent could evaluate in better perspective.  In each individual case, factors much more profound than a mere medical judgment may weigh heavily in the scales.  The overriding consideration is that the right to make the choice be exercised as wisely as possible.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Court assumes that parental consent is an appropriate requirement if the minor is not capable of understanding the procedure and of appreciating its consequences and those of available alternatives.  This assumption is, of course, correct and consistent with the predicate which underlies all state legislation seeking to protect minors from the consequences of decisions they are not yet prepared to make.  In all such situations, chronological age has been the basis for imposition of a restraint on the minor's freedom of choice even though \\nPage 428 U. S. 105\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t it is perfectly obvious that such a yardstick is imprecise, and perhaps even unjust in particular cases.  The Court seems to assume that the capacity to conceive a child and the judgment of the physician are the only constitutionally permissible yardsticks for determining whether a young woman can independently make the abortion decision.  I doubt the accuracy of the Court's empirical judgment.  Even if it were correct, however, as a matter of constitutional law I think a State has power to conclude otherwise, and to select a chronological age as its standard.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn short, the State's interest in the welfare of its young citizens is sufficient, in my judgment, to support the parental consent requirement.\\n\",\n          \"\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nRoe v.

The Georgia statutes, in\\ncontrast, have a modern cast, and are a legislative product that,\\nto an extent at least, obviously reflects the influences of recent\\nattitudinal change, of advancing medical knowledge and techniques,\\nand of new thinking about an old issue.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe forthwith acknowledge our awareness of the sensitive and\\nemotional nature of the abortion controversy, of the vigorous\\nopposing views, even among physicians, and of the deep and\\nseemingly absolute convictions that the subject inspires. One's\\nphilosophy, one's experiences, one's exposure to the raw edges of\\nhuman existence, one's religious training, one's attitudes toward\\nlife and family and their values, and the moral standards one\\nestablishes and seeks to observe, are all likely to influence and\\nto color one's thinking and conclusions about abortion.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn addition, population growth, pollution, poverty, and racial\\novertones tend to complicate and not to simplify the problem.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOur task, of course, is to resolve the issue by constitutional\\nmeasurement, free of emotion and of predilection.

He\\ndescribed conditions of patients who came to him seeking abortions,\\nand he claimed that for many cases he, as a physician, was unable\\nto determine whether they fell within or outside the exception\\nrecognized by Article 1196. He alleged that, as a consequence, the\\nstatutes were vague and uncertain, in violation of the Fourteenth\\nAmendment, and that they violated his own and his patients' rights\\nto privacy in the doctor-patient relationship and his own right to\\npractice medicine, rights he claimed were guaranteed by the First,\\nFourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJohn and Mary Doe, [Footnote\\n5] a married couple, filed a companion complaint to that of\\nRoe. They also named the District Attorney as defendant, claimed\\nlike constitutional deprivations, and sought declaratory and\\ninjunctive relief. The Does alleged that they were a childless\\ncouple; that Mrs. Doe was suffering from a \\\"neural-chemical\\\"\\ndisorder; that her physician had \\\"advised her to avoid pregnancy\\nuntil such time as her condition has materially improved\\\" (although\\na pregnancy at the present time would not present \\\"a serious risk\\\"\\nto her life); that, pursuant to medical advice, she had\\ndiscontinued use of birth control pills; and that, if she should\\nbecome pregnant, she would want to terminate the pregnancy by an\\nabortion performed by a competent, licensed physician under safe,\\nclinical conditions. By an amendment to their complaint, the Does\\npurported to sue \\\"on behalf of themselves and all couples similarly\\nsituated.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe two actions were consolidated and heard together by a duly\\nconvened three-judge district court. The suits thus presented the\\nsituations of the pregnant single woman, the childless couple, with\\nthe wife not pregnant,\\n[122]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand the licensed practicing physician, all joining in the attack\\non the Texas criminal abortion statutes. Upon the filing of\\naffidavits, motions were made for dismissal and for summary\\njudgment. The court held that Roe and members of her class, and Dr.\\nHallford, had standing to sue and presented justiciable\\ncontroversies, but that the Does had failed to allege facts\\nsufficient to state a present controversy, and did not have\\nstanding. It concluded that, with respect to the requests for a\\ndeclaratory judgment, abstention was not warranted. On the merits,\\nthe District Court held that the\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"fundamental right of single women and married persons to choose\\nwhether to have children is protected by the Ninth Amendment,\\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment,\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand that the Texas criminal abortion statutes were void on their\\nface because they were both unconstitutionally vague and\\nconstituted an overbroad infringement of the plaintiffs' Ninth\\nAmendment rights. The court then held that abstention was warranted\\nwith respect to the requests for an injunction. It therefore\\ndismissed the Does' complaint, declared the abortion statutes void,\\nand dismissed the application for injunctive relief. 314 F.\\nSupp. 1217, 1225\\n(ND Tex.1970).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe plaintiffs Roe and Doe and the intervenor Hallford, pursuant\\nto 28 U.S.C. \\u00c2\\u00a7 1253, have appealed to this Court from\\nthat part of the District Court's judgment denying the injunction.\\nThe defendant District Attorney has purported to cross-appeal,\\npursuant to the same statute, from the court's grant of declaratory\\nrelief to Roe and Hallford. Both sides also have taken protective\\nappeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth\\nCircuit. That court ordered the appeals held in abeyance pending\\ndecision here. We postponed decision on jurisdiction to the hearing\\non the merits. 402 U.S. 941 (1971)\\n[123]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt might have been preferable if the defendant, pursuant to our\\nRule 20, had presented to us a petition for certiorari before\\njudgment in the Court of Appeals with respect to the granting of\\nthe plaintiffs' prayer for declaratory relief. Our decisions in\\nMitchell v. Donovan, 398 U. S. 427 (1970), and\\nGunn v. University Committee, 399 U. S. 383 (1970), are\\nto the effect that \\u00c2\\u00a7 1253 does not authorize an appeal\\nto this Court from the grant or denial of declaratory relief alone.\\nWe conclude, nevertheless, that those decisions do not foreclose\\nour review of both the injunctive and the declaratory aspects of a\\ncase of this kind when it is properly here, as this one is, on\\nappeal under 1253 from specific denial of injunctive relief, and\\nthe arguments as to both aspects are necessarily identical. See\\nCarter v. Jury Comm'n, 396 U. S. 320 (1970);\\nFlorida Lime Growers v. Jacobsen, 362 U. S. 73, 80-81\\n(1960). It would be destructive of time and energy for all\\nconcerned were we to rule otherwise. Cf. Doe v. Bolton,\\npost, p. 179.\\nIV\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe are next confronted with issues of justiciability, standing,\\nand abstention. Have Roe and the Does established that \\\"personal\\nstake in the outcome of the controversy,\\\" Baker v. Carr,\\n369 U. S. 186,\\n204 (1962), that insures that\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an\\nadversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of\\njudicial resolution,\\\"\\nFlast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 101 (1968),\\nand Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 732\\n(1972)? And what effect did the pendency of criminal abortion\\ncharges against Dr. Hallford in state court have upon the propriety\\nof the federal court's granting relief to him as a\\nplaintiff-intervenor?\\n[124]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA. Jane Roe. Despite the use of the pseudonym, no\\nsuggestion is made that Roe is a fictitious person. For purposes of\\nher case, we accept as true, and as established, her existence; her\\npregnant state, as of the inception of her suit in March 1970 and\\nas late as May 21 of that year when she filed an alias affidavit\\nwith the District Court; and her inability to obtain a legal\\nabortion in Texas.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tViewing Roe's case as of the time of its filing and thereafter\\nuntil as late a May, there can be little dispute that it then\\npresented a case or controversy and that, wholly apart from the\\nclass aspects, she, as a pregnant single woman thwarted by the\\nTexas criminal abortion laws, had standing to challenge those\\nstatutes. Abele v. Markle, 452 F.2d 1121, 1125 (CA2 1971);\\nCrossen v. Breckenridge, 446 F.2d 833, 838-839 (CA6 1971);\\nPoe v. Menghini, 339 F.\\nSupp. 986, 990-991 (Kan.1972). See Truax v. Raich,\\n239 U. S. 33\\n(1915). Indeed, we do not read the appellee's brief as really\\nasserting anything to the contrary. The \\\"logical nexus between the\\nstatus asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated,\\\" Flast\\nv. Cohen, 392 U.S. at 102, and the necessary degree of\\ncontentiousness, Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U. S. 103 (1969), are\\nboth present.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe appellee notes, however, that the record does not disclose\\nthat Roe was pregnant at the time of the District Court hearing on\\nMay 22, 1970, [Footnote 6] or\\non the following June 17 when the court's opinion and judgment were\\nfiled. And he suggests that Roe's case must now be moot because she\\nand all other members of her class are no longer subject to any\\n1970 pregnancy.\\n[125]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe usual rule in federal cases is that an actual controversy\\nmust exist at stages of appellate or certiorari review, and not\\nsimply at the date the action is initiated. United States v.\\nMunsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36 (1950);\\nGolden v. Zwickler, supra; SEC v. Medical Committee for Human\\nRights, 404 U.\\nS. 403 (1972).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBut when, as here, pregnancy is a significant fact in the\\nlitigation, the normal 266-day human gestation period is so short\\nthat the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate\\nprocess is complete. If that termination makes a case moot,\\npregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial\\nstage, and appellate review will be effectively denied. Our law\\nshould not be that rigid. Pregnancy often comes more than once to\\nthe same woman, and in the general population, if man is to\\nsurvive, it will always be with us. Pregnancy provides a classic\\njustification for a conclusion of nonmootness. It truly could be\\n\\\"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\\\" Southern Pacific\\nTerminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S. 498, 515\\n(1911). See Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U. S. 814, 816\\n(1969); Carroll v. Princess Anne, 393 U. S. 175, 178-179\\n(1968); United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 632-633\\n(1953).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe, therefore, agree with the District Court that Jane Roe had\\nstanding to undertake this litigation, that she presented a\\njusticiable controversy, and that the termination of her 1970\\npregnancy has not rendered her case moot.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tB. Dr. Hallford. The doctor's position is different. He\\nentered Roe's litigation as a plaintiff-intervenor, alleging in his\\ncomplaint that he:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"[I]n the past has been arrested for violating the Texas\\nAbortion Laws and at the present time stands charged by indictment\\nwith violating said laws in the Criminal District Court of Dallas\\nCounty, Texas to-wit: (1) The State of Texas vs.\\n[126]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJames H. Hallford, No. C-69-5307-IH, and (2) The State of Texas\\nvs. James H. Hallford, No. C-692524-H. In both cases, the defendant\\nis charged with\\nabortion.\\u00c2\\u00a0.\\u00c2\\u00a0.\\u00c2\\u00a0.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn his application for leave to intervene, the doctor made like\\nrepresentations as to the abortion charges pending in the state\\ncourt. These representations were also repeated in the affidavit he\\nexecuted and filed in support of his motion for summary\\njudgment.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDr. Hallford is, therefore, in the position of seeking, in a\\nfederal court, declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to\\nthe same statutes under which he stands charged in criminal\\nprosecutions simultaneously pending in state court. Although he\\nstated that he has been arrested in the past for violating the\\nState's abortion laws, he makes no allegation of any substantial\\nand immediate threat to any federally protected right that cannot\\nbe asserted in his defense against the state prosecutions. Neither\\nis there any allegation of harassment or bad faith prosecution. In\\norder to escape the rule articulated in the cases cited in the next\\nparagraph of this opinion that, absent harassment and bad faith, a\\ndefendant in a pending state criminal case cannot affirmatively\\nchallenge in federal court the statutes under which the State is\\nprosecuting him, Dr. Hallford seeks to distinguish his status as a\\npresent state defendant from his status as a \\\"potential future\\ndefendant,\\\" and to assert only the latter for standing purposes\\nhere.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe see no merit in that distinction. Our decision in Samuels\\nv. Mackell, 401\\nU. S. 66 (1971), compels the conclusion that the District Court\\nerred when it granted declaratory relief to Dr. Hallford instead of\\nrefraining from so doing. The court, of course, was correct in\\nrefusing to grant injunctive relief to the doctor. The reasons\\nsupportive of that action, however, are those expressed in\\nSamuels v. Mackell, supra, and in Younger\\nv.\\n[127]\\nHarris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971);\\nBoyle v. Landry, 401 U. S. 77 (1971);\\nPerez v. Ledesma, 401 U. S. 82 (1971); and\\nByrne v. Karaleis, 401 U. S. 216 (1971).\\nSee also Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479 (1965). We\\nnote, in passing, that Younger and its companion cases\\nwere decided after the three-judge District Court decision in this\\ncase.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDr. Hallford's complaint in intervention, therefore, is to be\\ndismissed. [Footnote 7] He is\\nremitted to his defenses in the state criminal proceedings against\\nhim. We reverse the judgment of the District Court insofar as it\\ngranted Dr. Hallford relief and failed to dismiss his complaint in\\nintervention.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC. The Does. In view of our ruling as to Roe's standing\\nin her case, the issue of the Does' standing in their case has\\nlittle significance. The claims they assert are essentially the\\nsame as those of Roe, and they attack the same statutes.\\nNevertheless, we briefly note the Does' posture.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTheir pleadings present them as a childless married couple, the\\nwoman not being pregnant, who have no desire to have children at\\nthis time because of their having received medical advice that Mrs.\\nDoe should avoid pregnancy, and for \\\"other highly personal\\nreasons.\\\" But they \\\"fear .\\u00c2\\u00a0.\\u00c2\\u00a0. they may\\nface the prospect of becoming\\n[128]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tparents.\\\" And if pregnancy ensues, they \\\"would want to\\nterminate\\\" it by an abortion. They assert an inability to obtain an\\nabortion legally in Texas and, consequently, the prospect of\\nobtaining an illegal abortion there or of going outside Texas to\\nsome place where the procedure could be obtained legally and\\ncompetently.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe thus have as plaintiffs a married couple who have, as their\\nasserted immediate and present injury, only an alleged \\\"detrimental\\neffect upon [their] marital happiness\\\" because they are forced to\\n\\\"the choice of refraining from normal sexual relations or of\\nendangering Mary Doe's health through a possible pregnancy.\\\" Their\\nclaim is that, sometime in the future, Mrs. Doe might become\\npregnant because of possible failure of contraceptive measures,\\nand, at that time in the future, she might want an abortion that\\nmight then be illegal under the Texas statutes.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis very phrasing of the Does' position reveals its speculative\\ncharacter. Their alleged injury rests on possible future\\ncontraceptive failure, possible future pregnancy, possible future\\nunpreparedness for parenthood, and possible future impairment of\\nhealth. Any one or more of these several possibilities may not take\\nplace, and all may not combine. In the Does' estimation, these\\npossibilities might have some real or imagined impact upon their\\nmarital happiness. But we are not prepared to say that the bare\\nallegation of so indirect an injury is sufficient to present an\\nactual case or controversy. Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. at\\n41-42; Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S. at 109-110; Abele\\nv. Markle, 452 F.2d at 1124-1125; Crossen v.\\nBreckenridge, 446 F.2d at 839. The Does' claim falls far short\\nof those resolved otherwise in the cases that the Does urge upon\\nus, namely, Investment Co. Institute v. Camp, 401 U. S. 617 (1971);\\nData Processing Service v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150 (1970);\\n[129]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97 (1968).\\nSee also Truax v. Raich, 239 U. S. 33 (1915).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Does therefore are not appropriate plaintiffs in this\\nlitigation. Their complaint was properly dismissed by the District\\nCourt, and we affirm that dismissal.\\nV\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe principal thrust of appellant's attack on the Texas statutes\\nis that they improperly invade a right, said to be possessed by the\\npregnant woman, to choose to terminate her pregnancy. Appellant\\nwould discover this right in the concept of personal \\\"liberty\\\"\\nembodied in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause; or in\\npersonal, marital, familial, and sexual privacy said to be\\nprotected by the Bill of Rights or its penumbras, see Griswold\\nv. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965);\\nEisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972);\\nid. at 460 (WHITE, J., concurring in result); or among\\nthose rights reserved to the people by the Ninth Amendment,\\nGriswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. at 486 (Goldberg, J.,\\nconcurring). Before addressing this claim, we feel it desirable\\nbriefly to survey, in several aspects, the history of abortion, for\\nsuch insight as that history may afford us, and then to examine the\\nstate purposes and interests behind the criminal abortion laws.\\nVI\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt perhaps is not generally appreciated that the restrictive\\ncriminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are\\nof relatively recent vintage. Those laws, generally proscribing\\nabortion or its attempt at any time during pregnancy except when\\nnecessary to preserve the pregnant woman's life, are not of ancient\\nor even of common law origin. Instead, they derive from statutory\\nchanges effected, for the most part, in the latter half of the 19th\\ncentury.\\n[130]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1. Ancient attitudes. These are not capable of precise\\ndetermination. We are told that, at the time of the Persian Empire,\\nabortifacients were known, and that criminal abortions were\\nseverely punished. [Footnote 8]\\nWe are also told, however, that abortion was practiced in Greek\\ntimes as well as in the Roman Era, [Footnote 9] and that \\\"it was resorted to without scruple.\\\"\\n[Footnote 10] The Ephesian,\\nSoranos, often described as the greatest of the ancient\\ngynecologists, appears to have been generally opposed to Rome's\\nprevailing free-abortion practices. He found it necessary to think\\nfirst of the life of the mother, and he resorted to abortion when,\\nupon this standard, he felt the procedure advisable. [Footnote 11] Greek and Roman law\\nafforded little protection to the unborn. If abortion was\\nprosecuted in some places, it seems to have been based on a concept\\nof a violation of the father's right to his offspring. Ancient\\nreligion did not bar abortion. [Footnote 12]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2. The Hippocratic Oath. What then of the famous Oath\\nthat has stood so long as the ethical guide of the medical\\nprofession and that bears the name of the great Greek\\n(460(?)-377(?) B. C.), who has been described\\n[131]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tas the Father of Medicine, the \\\"wisest and the greatest\\npractitioner of his art,\\\" and the \\\"most important and most complete\\nmedical personality of antiquity,\\\" who dominated the medical\\nschools of his time, and who typified the sum of the medical\\nknowledge of the past? [Footnote\\n13] The Oath varies somewhat according to the particular\\ntranslation, but in any translation the content is clear:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest\\nany such counsel; and in like manner, I will not give to a woman a\\npessary to produce abortion, [Footnote 14]\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tor\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it,\\nnor will I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly, I will not\\ngive to a woman an abortive remedy. [Footnote 15]\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlthough the Oath is not mentioned in any of the principal\\nbriefs in this case or in Doe v. Bolton, post, p. 179, it\\nrepresents the apex of the development of strict ethical concepts\\nin medicine, and its influence endures to this day. Why did not the\\nauthority of Hippocrates dissuade abortion practice in his time and\\nthat of Rome? The late Dr. Edelstein provides us with a theory:\\n[Footnote 16] The Oath was\\nnot uncontested even in Hippocrates' day; only the Pythagorean\\nschool of philosophers frowned upon the related act of suicide.\\nMost Greek thinkers, on the other hand, commended abortion, at\\nleast prior to viability. See Plato, Republic, V, 461;\\nAristotle, Politics, VII, 1335b 25. For the Pythagoreans, however,\\nit was a matter of dogma. For them, the embryo was animate from the\\nmoment of conception, and abortion meant destruction of a living\\nbeing. The abortion clause of the Oath, therefore, \\\"echoes\\nPythagorean doctrines,\\\"\\n[132]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand \\\"[i]n no other stratum of Greek opinion were such views held\\nor proposed in the same spirit of uncompromising austerity.\\\"\\n[Footnote 17]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDr. Edelstein then concludes that the Oath originated in a group\\nrepresenting only a small segment of Greek opinion, and that it\\ncertainly was not accepted by all ancient physicians. He points out\\nthat medical writings down to Galen (A.D. 130-200) \\\"give evidence\\nof the violation of almost every one of its injunctions.\\\" [Footnote 18] But with the end of\\nantiquity, a decided change took place. Resistance against suicide\\nand against abortion became common. The Oath came to be popular.\\nThe emerging teachings of Christianity were in agreement with the\\nPythagorean ethic. The Oath \\\"became the nucleus of all medical\\nethics,\\\" and \\\"was applauded as the embodiment of truth.\\\" Thus,\\nsuggests Dr. Edelstein, it is \\\"a Pythagorean manifesto, and not the\\nexpression of an absolute standard of medical conduct.\\\" [Footnote 19]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis, it seems to us, is a satisfactory and acceptable\\nexplanation of the Hippocratic Oath's apparent rigidity. It enables\\nus to understand, in historical context, a long-accepted and\\nrevered statement of medical ethics.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t3. The common law. It is undisputed that, at common\\nlaw, abortion performed before \\\"quickening\\\" -- the first\\nrecognizable movement of the fetus in utero, appearing\\nusually from the 16th to the 18th week of pregnancy [Footnote 20] -- was not an indictable\\noffense. [Footnote 21] The\\nabsence\\n[133]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof a common law crime for pre-quickening abortion appears to\\nhave developed from a confluence of earlier philosophical,\\ntheological, and civil and canon law concepts of when life begins.\\nThese disciplines variously approached the question in terms of the\\npoint at which the embryo or fetus became \\\"formed\\\" or recognizably\\nhuman, or in terms of when a \\\"person\\\" came into being, that is,\\ninfused with a \\\"soul\\\" or \\\"animated.\\\" A loose consensus evolved in\\nearly English law that these events occurred at some point between\\nconception and live birth. [Footnote 22] This was \\\"mediate animation.\\\" Although\\n[134]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChristian theology and the canon law came to fix the point of\\nanimation at 40 days for a male and 80 days for a female, a view\\nthat persisted until the 19th century, there was otherwise little\\nagreement about the precise time of formation or animation. There\\nwas agreement, however, that, prior to this point, the fetus was to\\nbe regarded as part of the mother, and its destruction, therefore,\\nwas not homicide. Due to continued uncertainty about the precise\\ntime when animation occurred, to the lack of any empirical basis\\nfor the 40-80-day view, and perhaps to Aquinas' definition of\\nmovement as one of the two first principles of life, Bracton\\nfocused upon quickening as the critical point. The significance of\\nquickening was echoed by later common law scholars, and found its\\nway into the received common law in this country.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhether abortion of a quick fetus was a felony at common law, or\\neven a lesser crime, is still disputed. Bracton, writing early in\\nthe 13th century, thought it homicide. [Footnote 23] But the later and predominant view,\\nfollowing the great common law scholars, has been that it was, at\\nmost, a lesser offense. In a frequently cited\\n[135]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpassage, Coke took the position that abortion of a woman \\\"quick\\nwith childe\\\" is \\\"a great misprision, and no murder.\\\" [Footnote 24] Blackstone followed, saying\\nthat, while abortion after quickening had once been considered\\nmanslaughter (though not murder), \\\"modern law\\\" took a less severe\\nview. [Footnote 25] A recent\\nreview of the common law precedents argues, however, that those\\nprecedents contradict Coke, and that even post-quickening abortion\\nwas never established as a common law crime. [Footnote 26] This is of some importance,\\nbecause, while most American courts ruled, in holding or dictum,\\nthat abortion of an unquickened fetus was not criminal under their\\nreceived common law, [Footnote\\n27] others followed Coke in stating that abortion\\n[136]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof a quick fetus was a \\\"misprision,\\\" a term they translated to\\nmean \\\"misdemeanor.\\\" [Footnote\\n28] That their reliance on Coke on this aspect of the law was\\nuncritical and, apparently in all the reported cases, dictum (due\\nprobably to the paucity of common law prosecutions for\\npost-quickening abortion), makes it now appear doubtful that\\nabortion was ever firmly established as a common law crime even\\nwith respect to the destruction of a quick fetus.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t4. The English statutory law. England's first criminal\\nabortion statute, Lord Ellenborough's Act, 43 Geo. 3, c. 58, came\\nin 1803. It made abortion of a quick fetus, \\u00c2\\u00a7 1, a\\ncapital crime, but, in \\u00c2\\u00a7 2, it provided lesser\\npenalties for the felony of abortion before quickening, and thus\\npreserved the \\\"quickening\\\" distinction. This contrast was continued\\nin the general revision of 1828, 9 Geo. 4, c. 31, \\u00c2\\u00a7 13.\\nIt disappeared, however, together with the death penalty, in 1837,\\n7 Will. 4 & 1 Vict., c. 85. \\u00c2\\u00a7 6, and did not\\nreappear in the Offenses Against the Person Act of 1861, 24 &\\n25 Vict., c. 100, \\u00c2\\u00a7 59, that formed the core of English\\nanti-abortion law until the liberalizing reforms of 1967. In 1929,\\nthe Infant Life (Preservation) Act, 19 & 20 Geo. 5, c. 34, came\\ninto being. Its emphasis was upon the destruction of \\\"the life of a\\nchild capable of being born alive.\\\" It made a willful act performed\\nwith the necessary intent a felony. It contained a proviso that one\\nwas not to be\\n[137]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfound guilty of the offense\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"unless it is proved that the act which caused the death of the\\nchild was not done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving\\nthe life of the mother.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA seemingly notable development in the English law was the case\\nof Rex v. Bourne, [1939] 1 K.B. 687. This case apparently\\nanswered in the affirmative the question whether an abortion\\nnecessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman was excepted\\nfrom the criminal penalties of the 1861 Act. In his instructions to\\nthe jury, Judge Macnaghten referred to the 1929 Act, and observed\\nthat that Act related to \\\"the case where a child is killed by a\\nwillful act at the time when it is being delivered in the ordinary\\ncourse of nature.\\\" Id. at 691. He concluded that the 1861\\nAct's use of the word \\\"unlawfully,\\\" imported the same meaning\\nexpressed by the specific proviso in the 1929 Act, even though\\nthere was no mention of preserving the mother's life in the 1861\\nAct. He then construed the phrase \\\"preserving the life of the\\nmother\\\" broadly, that is, \\\"in a reasonable sense,\\\" to include a\\nserious and permanent threat to the mother's health, and instructed\\nthe jury to acquit Dr. Bourne if it found he had acted in a good\\nfaith belief that the abortion was necessary for this purpose.\\nId. at 693-694. The jury did acquit.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRecently, Parliament enacted a new abortion law. This is the\\nAbortion Act of 1967, 15 & 16 Eliz. 2, c. 87. The Act permits a\\nlicensed physician to perform an abortion where two other licensed\\nphysicians agree (a)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the\\nlife of the pregnant woman, or of injury to the physical or mental\\nhealth of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her\\nfamily, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated,\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tor (b)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"that there is a substantial risk that, if the child were born\\nit would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as\\n[138]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto be seriously handicapped.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Act also provides that, in making this determination,\\n\\\"account may be taken of the pregnant woman's actual or reasonably\\nforeseeable environment.\\\" It also permits a physician, without the\\nconcurrence of others, to terminate a pregnancy where he is of the\\ngood faith opinion that the abortion \\\"is immediately necessary to\\nsave the life or to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical\\nor mental health of the pregnant woman.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t5. The American law. In this country, the law in effect\\nin all but a few States until mid-19th century was the preexisting\\nEnglish common law. Connecticut, the first State to enact abortion\\nlegislation, adopted in 1821 that part of Lord Ellenborough's Act\\nthat related to a woman \\\"quick with child.\\\" [Footnote 29] The death penalty was not\\nimposed. Abortion before quickening was made a crime in that State\\nonly in 1860. [Footnote 30]\\nIn 1828, New York enacted legislation [Footnote 31] that, in two respects, was to serve as\\na model for early anti-abortion statutes. First, while barring\\ndestruction of an unquickened fetus as well as a quick fetus, it\\nmade the former only a misdemeanor, but the latter second-degree\\nmanslaughter. Second, it incorporated a concept of therapeutic\\nabortion by providing that an abortion was excused if it\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"shall have been necessary to preserve the life of such mother,\\nor shall have been advised by two physicians to be necessary for\\nsuch purpose.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBy 1840, when Texas had received the common law, [Footnote 32] only eight American\\nStates\\n[139]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thad statutes dealing with abortion. [Footnote 33] It was not until after the War Between\\nthe States that legislation began generally to replace the common\\nlaw. Most of these initial statutes dealt severely with abortion\\nafter quickening, but were lenient with it before quickening. Most\\npunished attempts equally with completed abortions. While many\\nstatutes included the exception for an abortion thought by one or\\nmore physicians to be necessary to save the mother's life, that\\nprovision soon disappeared, and the typical law required that the\\nprocedure actually be necessary for that purpose. Gradually, in the\\nmiddle and late 19th century, the quickening distinction\\ndisappeared from the statutory law of most States and the degree of\\nthe offense and the penalties were increased. By the end of the\\n1950's, a large majority of the jurisdictions banned abortion,\\nhowever and whenever performed, unless done to save or preserve the\\nlife of the mother. [Footnote\\n34] The exceptions, Alabama and the District of Columbia,\\npermitted abortion to preserve the mother's health. [Footnote 35] Three States permitted\\nabortions that were not \\\"unlawfully\\\" performed or that were not\\n\\\"without lawful justification,\\\" leaving interpretation of those\\nstandards to the courts. [Footnote 36] In\\n[140]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe past several years, however, a trend toward liberalization\\nof abortion statutes has resulted in adoption, by about one-third\\nof the States, of less stringent laws, most of them patterned after\\nthe ALI Model Penal Code, \\u00c2\\u00a7 230.3, [Footnote 37] set forth as Appendix B to the\\nopinion in Doe v. Bolton, post, p. 205.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is thus apparent that, at common law, at the time of the\\nadoption of our Constitution, and throughout the major portion of\\nthe 19th century, abortion was viewed with less disfavor than under\\nmost American statutes currently in effect. Phrasing it another\\nway, a woman enjoyed a substantially broader right to terminate a\\npregnancy than she does in most States today. At least with respect\\nto the early stage of pregnancy, and very possibly without such a\\nlimitation, the opportunity\\n[141]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto make this choice was present in this country well into the\\n19th century. Even later, the law continued for some time to treat\\nless punitively an abortion procured in early pregnancy.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t6. The position of the American Medical Association.\\nThe anti-abortion mood prevalent in this country in the late 19th\\ncentury was shared by the medical profession. Indeed, the attitude\\nof the profession may have played a significant role in the\\nenactment of stringent criminal abortion legislation during that\\nperiod.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAn AMA Committee on Criminal Abortion was appointed in May,\\n1857. It presented its report, 12 Trans. of the Am.Med.Assn. 778\\n(1859), to the Twelfth Annual Meeting. That report observed that\\nthe Committee had been appointed to investigate criminal abortion\\n\\\"with a view to its general suppression.\\\" It deplored abortion and\\nits frequency and it listed three causes of \\\"this general\\ndemoralization\\\":\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"The first of these causes is a widespread popular ignorance of\\nthe true character of the crime -- a belief, even among mothers\\nthemselves, that the foetus is not alive till after the period of\\nquickening.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"The second of the agents alluded to is the fact that the\\nprofession themselves are frequently supposed careless of foetal\\nlife.\\u00c2\\u00a0.\\u00c2\\u00a0.\\u00c2\\u00a0.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"The third reason of the frightful extent of this crime is found\\nin the grave defects of our laws, both common and statute, as\\nregards the independent and actual existence of the child before\\nbirth, as a living being. These errors, which are sufficient in\\nmost instances to prevent conviction, are based, and only based,\\nupon mistaken and exploded medical dogmas. With strange\\ninconsistency, the law fully acknowledges the foetus in\\nutero and its inherent rights, for civil purposes; while\\npersonally and as criminally affected, it fails to recognize\\nit,\\n[142]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand to its life as yet denies all protection.\\\"\\nId. at 776. The Committee then offered, and the\\nAssociation adopted, resolutions protesting \\\"against such\\nunwarrantable destruction of human life,\\\" calling upon state\\nlegislatures to revise their abortion laws, and requesting the\\ncooperation of state medical societies \\\"in pressing the subject.\\\"\\nId. at 28, 78.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn 1871, a long and vivid report was submitted by the Committee\\non Criminal Abortion. It ended with the observation,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"We had to deal with human life. In a matter of less importance,\\nwe could entertain no compromise.

The position of the American Bar Association. At its\\nmeeting in February, 1972, the ABA House of Delegates approved,\\nwith 17 opposing votes, the Uniform Abortion Act that had been\\ndrafted and approved the preceding August by the Conference of\\nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws. 58 A.B.A.J. 380 (1972). We set\\nforth the Act in full in the margin. [Footnote 40] The\\n[147]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOpinion of the Court Conference has appended an enlightening\\nPrefatory Note. [Footnote\\n41]\\nVII\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThree reasons have been advanced to explain historically the\\nenactment of criminal abortion laws in the 19th century and to\\njustify their continued existence.\\n[148]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt has been argued occasionally that these laws were the product\\nof a Victorian social concern to discourage illicit sexual conduct.\\nTexas, however, does not advance this justification in the present\\ncase, and it appears that no court or commentator has taken the\\nargument seriously. [Footnote\\n42] The appellants and amici contend, moreover, that\\nthis is not a proper state purpose, at all and suggest that, if it\\nwere, the Texas statutes are overbroad in protecting it, since the\\nlaw fails to distinguish between married and unwed mothers.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA second reason is concerned with abortion as a medical\\nprocedure. When most criminal abortion laws were first enacted, the\\nprocedure was a hazardous one for the woman. [Footnote 43] This was particularly true prior\\nto the\\n[149]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdevelopment of antisepsis. Antiseptic techniques, of course,\\nwere based on discoveries by Lister, Pasteur, and others first\\nannounced in 1867, but were not generally accepted and employed\\nuntil about the turn of the century. Abortion mortality was high.\\nEven after 1900, and perhaps until as late as the development of\\nantibiotics in the 1940's, standard modern techniques such as\\ndilation and curettage were not nearly so safe as they are today.\\nThus, it has been argued that a State's real concern in enacting a\\ncriminal abortion law was to protect the pregnant woman, that is,\\nto restrain her from submitting to a procedure that placed her life\\nin serious jeopardy.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tModern medical techniques have altered this situation.\\nAppellants and various amici refer to medical data\\nindicating that abortion in early pregnancy, that is, prior to the\\nend of the first trimester, although not without its risk, is now\\nrelatively safe. Mortality rates for women undergoing early\\nabortions, where the procedure is legal, appear to be as low as or\\nlower than the rates for normal childbirth. [Footnote 44] Consequently, any interest of\\nthe State in protecting the woman from an inherently hazardous\\nprocedure, except when it would be equally dangerous for her to\\nforgo it, has largely disappeared. Of course, important state\\ninterests in the areas of health and medical standards do\\nremain.\\n[150]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe State has a legitimate interest in seeing to it that\\nabortion, like any other medical procedure, is performed under\\ncircumstances that insure maximum safety for the patient. This\\ninterest obviously extends at least to the performing physician and\\nhis staff, to the facilities involved, to the availability of\\nafter-care, and to adequate provision for any complication or\\nemergency that might arise. The prevalence of high mortality rates\\nat illegal \\\"abortion mills\\\" strengthens, rather than weakens, the\\nState's interest in regulating the conditions under which abortions\\nare performed. Moreover, the risk to the woman increases as her\\npregnancy continues. Thus, the State retains a definite interest in\\nprotecting the woman's own health and safety when an abortion is\\nproposed at a late stage of pregnancy.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe third reason is the State's interest -- some phrase it in\\nterms of duty -- in protecting prenatal life. Some of the argument\\nfor this justification rests on the theory that a new human life is\\npresent from the moment of conception. [Footnote 45] The State's interest and general\\nobligation to protect life then extends, it is argued, to prenatal\\nlife. Only when the life of the pregnant mother herself is at\\nstake, balanced against the life she carries within her, should the\\ninterest of the embryo or fetus not prevail. Logically, of course,\\na legitimate state interest in this area need not stand or fall on\\nacceptance of the belief that life begins at conception or at some\\nother point prior to live birth. In assessing the State's interest,\\nrecognition may be given to the less rigid claim that as long as at\\nleast potential life is involved, the State may assert interests\\nbeyond the protection of the pregnant woman alone.\\n[151]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tParties challenging state abortion laws have sharply disputed in\\nsome courts the contention that a purpose of these laws, when\\nenacted, was to protect prenatal life. [Footnote 46] Pointing to the absence of legislative\\nhistory to support the contention, they claim that most state laws\\nwere designed solely to protect the woman. Because medical advances\\nhave lessened this concern, at least with respect to abortion in\\nearly pregnancy, they argue that with respect to such abortions the\\nlaws can no longer be justified by any state interest. There is\\nsome scholarly support for this view of original purpose. [Footnote 47] The few state courts\\ncalled upon to interpret their laws in the late 19th and early 20th\\ncenturies did focus on the State's interest in protecting the\\nwoman's health, rather than in preserving the embryo and fetus.\\n[Footnote 48] Proponents of\\nthis view point out that in many States, including Texas, [Footnote 49] by statute or\\njudicial interpretation, the pregnant woman herself could not be\\nprosecuted for self-abortion or for cooperating in an abortion\\nperformed upon her by another. [Footnote 50] They claim that adoption of the \\\"quickening\\\"\\ndistinction through received common\\n[152]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlaw and state statutes tacitly recognizes the greater health\\nhazards inherent in late abortion and impliedly repudiates the\\ntheory that life begins at conception.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is with these interests, and the eight to be attached to\\nthem, that this case is concerned.\\nVIII\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of\\nprivacy. In a line of decisions, however, going back perhaps as far\\nas Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U. S. 250, 251\\n(1891), the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy,\\nor a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist\\nunder the Constitution. In varying contexts, the Court or\\nindividual Justices have, indeed, found at least the roots of that\\nright in the First Amendment, Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557, 564\\n(1969); in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, Terry v. Ohio,\\n392 U. S. 1, 8-9\\n(1968), Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 350\\n(1967), Boyd v. United States, 116 U.

Nebraska, supra.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth\\nAmendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state\\naction, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in\\nthe Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad\\nenough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate\\nher pregnancy. The detriment that the State would impose upon the\\npregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent.\\nSpecific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early\\npregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may\\nforce upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological\\nharm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by\\nchild care. There is also the distress, for all concerned,\\nassociated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of\\nbringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and\\notherwise, to care for it. In other cases, as in this one, the\\nadditional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood\\nmay be involved. All these are factors the woman and her\\nresponsible physician necessarily will consider in\\nconsultation.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOn the basis of elements such as these, appellant and some\\namici argue that the woman's right is absolute and that\\nshe is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in\\nwhatever way, and for whatever reason she alone chooses. With this\\nwe do not agree. Appellant's arguments that Texas either has no\\nvalid interest at all in regulating the abortion decision, or no\\ninterest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman's\\nsole determination, are unpersuasive. The\\n[154]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCourt's decisions recognizing a right of privacy also\\nacknowledge that some state regulation in areas protected by that\\nright is appropriate. As noted above, a State may properly assert\\nimportant interests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical\\nstandards, and in protecting potential life. At some point in\\npregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently\\ncompelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the\\nabortion decision. The privacy right involved, therefore, cannot be\\nsaid to be absolute. In fact, it is not clear to us that the claim\\nasserted by some amici that one has an unlimited right to\\ndo with one's body as one pleases bears a close relationship to the\\nright of privacy previously articulated in the Court's decisions.\\nThe Court has refused to recognize an unlimited right of this kind\\nin the past. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11 (1905)\\n(vaccination); Buck v. Bell, 274 U. S. 200 (1927) (\\nsterilization).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy\\nincludes the abortion decision, but that this right is not\\nunqualified, and must be considered against important state\\ninterests in regulation.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWe note that those federal and state courts that have recently\\nconsidered abortion law challenges have reached the same\\nconclusion. A majority, in addition to the District Court in the\\npresent case, have held state laws unconstitutional, at least in\\npart, because of vagueness or because of overbreadth and abridgment\\nof rights.

Supp. at 1222-1223.\\nAppellant and appellee both contest that holding. Appellant, as has\\nbeen indicated, claims an absolute right that bars any state\\nimposition of criminal penalties in the area. Appellee argues that\\nthe State's determination to recognize and protect prenatal life\\nfrom and after conception constitutes a compelling state interest.\\nAs noted above, we do not agree fully with either formulation.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA. The appellee and certain amici argue that the fetus\\nis a \\\"person\\\" within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth\\nAmendment. In support of this, they outline at length and in detail\\nthe well known facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of\\npersonhood is established, the appellant's case, of course,\\ncollapses,\\n[157]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed\\nspecifically by the Amendment. The appellant conceded as much on\\nreargument. [Footnote 51] On\\nthe other hand, the appellee conceded on reargument [Footnote 52] that no case could be cited\\nthat holds that a fetus is a person within the meaning of the\\nFourteenth Amendment.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Constitution does not define \\\"person\\\" in so many words.\\nSection 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains three references to\\n\\\"person.\\\" The first, in defining \\\"citizens,\\\" speaks of \\\"persons\\nborn or naturalized in the United States.\\\" The word also appears\\nboth in the Due Process Clause and in the Equal Protection Clause.\\n\\\"Person\\\" is used in other places in the Constitution: in the\\nlisting of qualifications for Representatives and Senators, Art. I,\\n\\u00c2\\u00a7 2, cl. 2, and \\u00c2\\u00a7 3, cl. 3; in the\\nApportionment Clause, Art. I, \\u00c2\\u00a7 2, cl. 3; [Footnote 53] in the Migration and\\nImportation provision, Art. I, \\u00c2\\u00a7 9, cl. 1; in the\\nEmolument Clause, Art. I, \\u00c2\\u00a7 9, cl. 8; in the Electors\\nprovisions, Art.

But in nearly all these\\ninstances, the use of the word is such that it has application only\\npost-natally. None indicates, with any assurance, that it has any\\npossible pre-natal application. [Footnote 54]\\n[158]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAll this, together with our observation, supra, that,\\nthroughout the major portion of the 19th century, prevailing legal\\nabortion practices were far freer than they are today, persuades us\\nthat the word \\\"person,\\\" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does\\nnot include the unborn.

S. 62 (1971),\\ninferentially is to the same effect, for we there would not have\\nindulged in statutory interpretation favorable to abortion in\\nspecified circumstances if the necessary consequence was the\\ntermination of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment\\nprotection.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis conclusion, however, does not of itself fully answer the\\ncontentions raised by Texas, and we pass on to other\\nconsiderations.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tB. The pregnant woman cannot be isolated in her privacy. She\\ncarries an embryo and, later, a fetus, if one accepts the medical\\ndefinitions of the developing young in the human uterus.\\nSee Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 478-479, 547\\n(24th ed.1965). The situation therefore is inherently different\\nfrom marital intimacy, or bedroom possession of obscene material,\\nor marriage, or procreation, or education, with which Eisenstadt\\nand Griswold, Stanley, Loving, Skinner, and Pierce and Meyer were\\nrespectively concerned. As we have intimated above, it is\\nreasonable and appropriate for a State to decide that, at some\\npoint in time another interest, that of health of the mother or\\nthat of potential human life, becomes significantly involved. The\\nwoman's privacy is no longer sole and any right of privacy she\\npossesses must be measured accordingly.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTexas urges that, apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, life\\nbegins at conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that,\\ntherefore, the State has a compelling interest in protecting that\\nlife from and after conception. We need not resolve the difficult\\nquestion of when life begins. When those trained in the respective\\ndisciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to\\narrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the\\ndevelopment of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate\\nas to the answer.\\n[160]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt should be sufficient to note briefly the wide divergence of\\nthinking on this most sensitive and difficult question. There has\\nalways been strong support for the view that life does not begin\\nuntil live' birth. This was the belief of the Stoics. [Footnote 56] It appears to be the\\npredominant, though not the unanimous, attitude of the Jewish\\nfaith. [Footnote 57] It may\\nbe taken to represent also the position of a large segment of the\\nProtestant community, insofar as that can be ascertained; organized\\ngroups that have taken a formal position on the abortion issue have\\ngenerally regarded abortion as a matter for the conscience of the\\nindividual and her family. [Footnote 58] As we have noted, the common law found\\ngreater significance in quickening. Physician and their scientific\\ncolleagues have regarded that event with less interest and have\\ntended to focus either upon conception, upon live birth, or upon\\nthe interim point at which the fetus becomes \\\"viable,\\\" that is,\\npotentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with\\nartificial aid. [Footnote\\n59] Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28\\nweeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks. [Footnote 60] The Aristotelian theory of\\n\\\"mediate animation,\\\" that held sway throughout the Middle Ages and\\nthe Renaissance in Europe, continued to be official Roman Catholic\\ndogma until the 19th century, despite opposition to this\\n\\\"ensoulment\\\" theory from those in the Church who would recognize\\nthe existence of life from\\n[161]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe moment of conception. [Footnote 61] The latter is now, of course, the official\\nbelief of the Catholic Church. As one brief amicus\\ndiscloses, this is a view strongly held by many non-Catholics as\\nwell, and by many physicians. Substantial problems for precise\\ndefinition of this view are posed, however, by new embryological\\ndata that purport to indicate that conception is a \\\"process\\\" over\\ntime, rather than an event, and by new medical techniques such as\\nmenstrual extraction, the \\\"morning-after\\\" pill, implantation of\\nembryos, artificial insemination, and even artificial wombs.\\n[Footnote 62]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn areas other than criminal abortion, the law has been\\nreluctant to endorse any theory that life, as we recognize it,\\nbegins before live birth, or to accord legal rights to the unborn\\nexcept in narrowly defined situations and except when the rights\\nare contingent upon live birth. For example, the traditional rule\\nof tort law denied recovery for prenatal injuries even though the\\nchild was born alive. [Footnote\\n63] That rule has been changed in almost every jurisdiction. In\\nmost States, recovery is said to be permitted only if the fetus was\\nviable, or at least quick, when the injuries were sustained, though\\nfew\\n[162]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcourts have squarely so held. [Footnote 64] In a recent development, generally opposed\\nby the commentators, some States permit the parents of a stillborn\\nchild to maintain an action for wrongful death because of prenatal\\ninjuries. [Footnote 65] Such\\nan action, however, would appear to be one to vindicate the\\nparents' interest and is thus consistent with the view that the\\nfetus, at most, represents only the potentiality of life.\\nSimilarly, unborn children have been recognized as acquiring rights\\nor interests by way of inheritance or other devolution of property,\\nand have been represented by guardians ad litem. [Footnote 66] Perfection of the\\ninterests involved, again, has generally been contingent upon live\\nbirth. In short, the unborn have never been recognized in the law\\nas persons in the whole sense.\\nX\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn view of all this, we do not agree that, by adopting one\\ntheory of life, Texas may override the rights of the pregnant woman\\nthat are at stake. We repeat, however, that the State does have an\\nimportant and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the\\nhealth of the pregnant woman, whether she be a resident of the\\nState or a nonresident who seeks medical consultation and treatment\\nthere, and that it has still another important and\\nlegitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.\\nThese interests are separate and distinct. Each grows in\\nsubstantiality as the woman approaches\\n[163]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tterm and, at a point during pregnancy, each becomes\\n\\\"compelling.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWith respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in\\nthe health of the mother, the \\\"compelling\\\" point, in the light of\\npresent medical knowledge, is at approximately the end of the first\\ntrimester. This is so because of the now-established medical fact,\\nreferred to above at 149, that, until the end of the first\\ntrimester mortality in abortion may be less than mortality in\\nnormal childbirth. It follows that, from and after this point, a\\nState may regulate the abortion procedure to the extent that the\\nregulation reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of\\nmaternal health. Examples of permissible state regulation in this\\narea are requirements as to the qualifications of the person who is\\nto perform the abortion; as to the licensure of that person; as to\\nthe facility in which the procedure is to be performed, that is,\\nwhether it must be a hospital or may be a clinic or some other\\nplace of less-than-hospital status; as to the licensing of the\\nfacility; and the like.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis means, on the other hand, that, for the period of pregnancy\\nprior to this \\\"compelling\\\" point, the attending physician, in\\nconsultation with his patient, is free to determine, without\\nregulation by the State, that, in his medical judgment, the\\npatient's pregnancy should be terminated. If that decision is\\nreached, the judgment may be effectuated by an abortion free of\\ninterference by the State.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWith respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in\\npotential life, the \\\"compelling\\\" point is at viability. This is so\\nbecause the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful\\nlife outside the mother's womb. State regulation protective of\\nfetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological\\njustifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life\\nafter viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion\\n[164]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tduring that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the\\nlife or health of the mother.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMeasured against these standards, Art. 1196 of the Texas Penal\\nCode, in restricting legal abortions to those \\\"procured or\\nattempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of\\nthe mother,\\\" sweeps too broadly. The statute makes no distinction\\nbetween abortions performed early in pregnancy and those performed\\nlater, and it limits to a single reason, \\\"saving\\\" the mother's\\nlife, the legal justification for the procedure. The statute,\\ntherefore, cannot survive the constitutional attack made upon it\\nhere.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider the\\nadditional challenge to the Texas statute asserted on grounds of\\nvagueness. See United States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. at\\n67-72.\\nXI\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTo summarize and to repeat:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1. A state criminal abortion statute of the current Texas type,\\nthat excepts from criminality only a lifesaving procedure on behalf\\nof the mother, without regard to pregnancy stage and without\\nrecognition of the other interests involved, is violative of the\\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first\\ntrimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left\\nto the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending\\nphysician.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the\\nfirst trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health\\nof the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure\\nin ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in\\npromoting its interest in the potentiality of human life\\n[165]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmay, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion\\nexcept where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for\\nthe preservation of the life or health of the mother.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2. The State may define the term \\\"physician,\\\" as it has been\\nemployed in the preceding paragraphs of this Part XI of this\\nopinion, to mean only a physician currently licensed by the State,\\nand may proscribe any abortion by a person who is not a physician\\nas so defined.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIn Doe v. Bolton, post, p. 179, procedural requirements\\ncontained in one of the modern abortion statutes are considered.\\nThat opinion and this one, of course, are to be read together.\\n[Footnote 67]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis holding, we feel, is consistent with the relative weights\\nof the respective interests involved, with the lessons and examples\\nof medical and legal history, with the lenity of the common law,\\nand with the demands of the profound problems of the present day.\\nThe decision leaves the State free to place increasing restrictions\\non abortion as the period of pregnancy lengthens, so long as those\\nrestrictions are tailored to the recognized state interests. The\\ndecision vindicates the right of the physician to administer\\nmedical treatment according to his professional judgment up to the\\npoints where important\\n[166]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tstate interests provide compelling justifications for\\nintervention. Up to those points, the abortion decision in all its\\naspects is inherently, and primarily, a medical decision, and basic\\nresponsibility for it must rest with the physician. If an\\nindividual practitioner abuses the privilege of exercising proper\\nmedical judgment, the usual remedies, judicial and\\nintra-professional, are available.\\nXII\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOur conclusion that Art. 1196 is unconstitutional means, of\\ncourse, that the Texas abortion statutes, as a unit, must fall. The\\nexception of Art. 1196 cannot be struck down separately, for then\\nthe State would be left with a statute proscribing all abortion\\nprocedures no matter how medically urgent the case.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlthough the District Court granted appellant Roe declaratory\\nrelief, it stopped short of issuing an injunction against\\nenforcement of the Texas statutes.

Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a more complete\\nabridgment of a constitutional freedom than that worked by the\\ninflexible criminal statute now in force in Texas. The question\\nthen becomes whether the state interests advanced to justify this\\nabridgment can survive the \\\"particularly careful scrutiny\\\" that the\\nFourteenth Amendment here requires.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe asserted state interests are protection of the health and\\nsafety of the pregnant woman, and protection of the potential\\nfuture human life within her. These are legitimate objectives,\\namply sufficient to permit a State to regulate abortions as it does\\nother surgical procedures, and perhaps sufficient to permit a State\\nto regulate abortions more stringently, or even to prohibit them in\\nthe late stages of pregnancy. But such legislation is not before\\nus, and I think the Court today has thoroughly demonstrated that\\nthese state interests cannot constitutionally support the broad\\nabridgment of personal\\n[171]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tliberty worked by the existing Texas law. Accordingly, I join\\nthe Court's opinion holding that that law is invalid under the Due\\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Court's opinion brings to the decision of this troubling\\nquestion both extensive historical fact and a wealth of legal\\nscholarship. While the opinion thus commands my respect, I find\\nmyself nonetheless in fundamental disagreement with those parts of\\nit that invalidate the Texas statute in question, and therefore\\ndissent.\\nI\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Court's opinion decides that a State may impose virtually no\\nrestriction on the performance of abortions during the first\\ntrimester of pregnancy. Our previous decisions indicate that a\\nnecessary predicate for such an opinion is a plaintiff who was in\\nher first trimester of pregnancy at some time during the pendency\\nof her lawsuit. While a party may vindicate his own constitutional\\nrights, he may not seek vindication for the rights of others.\\nMoose Lodge v. Irvis, 407 U. S. 163 (1972);\\nSierra, Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727 (1972). The\\nCourt's statement of facts in this case makes clear, however, that\\nthe record in no way indicates the presence of such a plaintiff. We\\nknow only that plaintiff Roe at the time of filing her complaint\\nwas a pregnant woman; for aught that appears in this record, she\\nmay have been in her last trimester of pregnancy as of the date the\\ncomplaint was filed.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNothing in the Court's opinion indicates that Texas might not\\nconstitutionally apply its proscription of abortion as written to a\\nwoman in that stage of pregnancy. Nonetheless, the Court uses her\\ncomplaint against the Texas statute as a fulcrum for deciding that\\nStates may\\n[172]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\timpose virtually no restrictions on medical abortions performed\\nduring the first trimester of pregnancy. In deciding such a\\nhypothetical lawsuit, the Court departs from the longstanding\\nadmonition that it should never \\\"formulate a rule of constitutional\\nlaw broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to\\nbe applied.\\\" Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S.S. Co. v.\\nCommissioners of Emigration, 113 U. S. 33, 39 (1885).\\nSee also Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.

I have difficulty\\nin concluding, as the Court does, that the right of \\\"privacy\\\" is\\ninvolved in this case. Texas, by the statute here challenged, bars\\nthe performance of a medical abortion by a licensed physician on a\\nplaintiff such as Roe. A transaction resulting in an operation such\\nas this is not \\\"private\\\" in the ordinary usage of that word. Nor is\\nthe \\\"privacy\\\" that the Court finds here even a distant relative of\\nthe freedom from searches and seizures protected by the Fourth\\nAmendment to the Constitution, which the Court has referred to as\\nembodying a right to privacy. Katz v. United States,\\n389 U. S. 347\\n(1967).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIf the Court means by the term \\\"privacy\\\" no more than that the\\nclaim of a person to be free from unwanted state regulation of\\nconsensual transactions may be a form of \\\"liberty\\\" protected by the\\nFourteenth Amendment, there is no doubt that similar claims have\\nbeen upheld in our earlier decisions on the basis of that liberty.\\nI agree with the statement of MR. JUSTICE STEWART in his concurring\\nopinion that the \\\"liberty,\\\" against deprivation of which without\\ndue process the Fourteenth\\n[173]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAmendment protects, embraces more than the rights found in the\\nBill of Rights. But that liberty is not guaranteed absolutely\\nagainst deprivation, only against deprivation without due process\\nof law. The test traditionally applied in the area of social and\\neconomic legislation is whether or not a law such as that\\nchallenged has a rational relation to a valid state objective.\\nWilliamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483, 491\\n(1955). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\\nundoubtedly does place a limit, albeit a broad one, on legislative\\npower to enact laws such as this. If the Texas statute were to\\nprohibit an abortion even where the mother's life is in jeopardy, I\\nhave little doubt that such a statute would lack a rational\\nrelation to a valid state objective under the test stated in\\nWilliamson, supra. But the Court's sweeping invalidation\\nof any restrictions on abortion during the first trimester is\\nimpossible to justify under that standard, and the conscious\\nweighing of competing factors that the Court's opinion apparently\\nsubstitutes for the established test is far more appropriate to a\\nlegislative judgment than to a judicial one.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Court eschews the history of the Fourteenth Amendment in its\\nreliance on the \\\"compelling state interest\\\" test. See Weber v.\\nAetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164, 179 (1972)\\n(dissenting opinion). But the Court adds a new wrinkle to this test\\nby transposing it from the legal considerations associated with the\\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to this case\\narising under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\nUnless I misapprehend the consequences of this transplanting of the\\n\\\"compelling state interest test,\\\" the Court's opinion will\\naccomplish the seemingly impossible feat of leaving this area of\\nthe law more confused than it found it.\\n[174]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhile the Court's opinion quotes from the dissent of Mr. Justice\\nHolmes in Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 74 (1905),\\nthe result it reaches is more closely attuned to the majority\\nopinion of Mr. Justice Peckham in that case. As in Lochner\\nand similar cases applying substantive due process standards to\\neconomic and social welfare legislation, the adoption of the\\ncompelling state interest standard will inevitably require this\\nCourt to examine the legislative policies and pass on the wisdom of\\nthese policies in the very process of deciding whether a particular\\nstate interest put forward may or may not be \\\"compelling.\\\" The\\ndecision here to break pregnancy into three distinct terms and to\\noutline the permissible restrictions the State may impose in each\\none, for example, partakes more of judicial legislation than it\\ndoes of a determination of the intent of the drafters of the\\nFourteenth Amendment.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe fact that a majority of the States reflecting, after all,\\nthe majority sentiment in those States, have had restrictions on\\nabortions for at least a century is a strong indication, it seems\\nto me, that the asserted right to an abortion is not \\\"so rooted in\\nthe traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as\\nfundamental,\\\" Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934).\\nEven today, when society's views on abortion are changing, the very\\nexistence of the debate is evidence that the \\\"right\\\" to an abortion\\nis not so universally accepted as the appellant would have us\\nbelieve.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTo reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find\\nwithin the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was\\napparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment.

By the time of the adoption of\\nthe Fourteenth\\n[175]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAmendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state\\nor territorial legislatures limiting abortion. [Footnote 1] While many States have amended\\nor updated\\n[176]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect\\ntoday.

My\\nunderstanding of past practice is that a statute found\\n[178]\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto be invalid as applied to a particular plaintiff, but not\\nunconstitutional as a whole, is not simply \\\"struck down\\\" but is,\\ninstead, declared unconstitutional as applied to the fact situation\\nbefore the Court.

He may have drawn upon Exodus 21:22. At one point,\\nhowever, he expressed the view that human powers cannot determine\\nthe point during fetal development at which the critical change\\noccurs. See Augustine, De Origine Animae 4.4 (Pub.Law\\n44.527). See also W. Reany, The Creation of the Human\\nSoul, c. 2 and 83-86 (1932); Huser, The Crime of Abortion in Canon\\nLaw 15 (Catholic Univ. of America, Canon Law Studies No. 162,\\nWashington, D.C.1942).\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGalen, in three treatises related to embryology, accepted the\\nthinking of Aristotle and his followers.

The\\ntime period was bracketed to permit the various states to insert a\\nfigure more in keeping with the different conditions that might\\nexist among the states. Likewise, the language limiting the place\\nor places in which abortions may be performed was also bracketed to\\naccount for different conditions among the states. In addition,\\nlimitations on abortions after the initial 'unlimited' period were\\nplaced in brackets so that individual states may adopt all or any\\nof these reasons, or place further restrictions upon abortions\\nafter the initial period.\\\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\\"This Act does not contain any provision relating to medical\\nreview committees or prohibitions against sanctions imposed upon\\nmedical personnel refusing to participate in abortions because of\\nreligious or other similar reasons, or the like.

Neither in\\nTexas nor in any other State are all abortions prohibited. Despite\\nbroad proscription, an exception always exists. The exception\\ncontained in Art. 1196, for an abortion procured or attempted by\\nmedical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother, is\\ntypical. But if the fetus is a person who is not to be deprived of\\nlife without due process of law, and if the mother's condition is\\nthe sole determinant, does not the Texas exception appear to be out\\nof line with the Amendment's command?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThere are other inconsistencies between Fourteenth Amendment\\nstatus and the typical abortion statute. It has already been\\npointed out, n 49,\\nsupra, that, in Texas, the woman is not a principal or an\\naccomplice with respect to an abortion upon her. If the fetus is a\\nperson, why is the woman not a principal or an accomplice? Further,\\nthe penalty for criminal abortion specified by Art. 1195 is\\nsignificantly less than the maximum penalty for murder prescribed\\nby Art. 1257 of the Texas Penal Code.

Argued December 1, 2021\\u2014Decided June 24, 2022 \\nMississippi\\u2019s Gestational Age Act prov ides that \\u201c[e]xcept in a medical\\nemergency or in the case of a seve re fetal abnormality, a person shall\\nnot intentionally or knowingly perform . . . or induce an abortion of an \\nunborn human being if the probable gestational age of the unborn hu -\\nman being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15) weeks.\\u201d \\nMiss. Code Ann. \\u00a741\\u201341\\u2013191.  Respondents\\u2014Jackson Women\\u2019s Health \\nOrganization, an abortion clinic, and one of its doctors\\u2014challenged the\\nAct in Federal District Court, alleging that it violated this Court\\u2019s prec -\\nedents establishing a constitutional  right to abortion, in particular Roe \\nv. Wade , 410 U. S. 113, and Planned Parenthood of  Southeastern Pa. \\nv. Casey , 505 U. S. 833.  The District Court granted summary judg -\\nment in favor of respondents and permanently enjoined enforcement of the Act, reasoning that Mississippi\\u2019s 15-week restriction on abortion \\nviolates this Court\\u2019s cases forbidding  States to ban abortion pre-viabil-\\nity.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  Be fore this Court, petitioners defend \\nthe Act on the grounds that Roe and Casey  were wrongly decided and\\nthat the Act is constitutional becaus e it satisfies rational-basis review. \\nHeld : The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey\\nare overruled; and the au thority to regulate abortion is returned to the \\npeople and their elected representatives.  Pp. 8\\u201379.\\n(a) The critical question is wh ether the Constitution, properly un-\\nderstood, confers a right to  obtain an abortion. Casey \\u2019s controlling\\nopinion skipped over that question and reaffirmed Roe  solely on the\\nbasis of stare decisis . A proper application of stare decisis , however, \\nrequires an assessment of the st rength of the grounds on which Roe \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 2 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nSyllabus \\nwas based. The Court therefore turns to the question that the Casey\\nplurality did not consider.  Pp. 8\\u201332.\\n(1) First, the Court reviews th e standard that the Court\\u2019s cases \\nhave used to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s refer-\\nence to \\u201cliberty\\u201d protects a particul ar right.  The Constitution makes \\nno express reference to a right to obtain an abortion, but several con-\\nstitutional provisions have been o ffered as potential homes for an im-\\nplicit constitutional right. Roe held that the abortion right is part of a\\nright to privacy that springs from the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and\\nFourteenth Amendments.  See 410 U. S., at 152\\u2013153.  The Casey  Court \\ngrounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an\\nabortion is part of the \\u201cliberty\\u201d protected by the Fourteenth Amend-\\nment\\u2019s Due Process Clause. Others have suggested that support can be found in the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s Equal Protection Clause, but \\nthat theory is squarely foreclosed by the Court\\u2019s prec edents, which es-\\ntablish that a State\\u2019s regulation of abortion is not a sex-based classifi-\\ncation and is thus not subject to th e heightened scrutiny that applies \\nto such classifications.

Rather, regulations and prohibitions of abortion are governed by\\nthe same standard of review as ot her health and safety measures. \\nPp. 9\\u201311.\\n(2) Next, the Court examines wh ether the right to obtain an abor -\\ntion is rooted in the Nation\\u2019s history and tradition and whether it is anessential component of \\u201cordered lib erty.\\u201d  The Court finds that the \\nright to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation\\u2019s history and tradi-\\ntion.  The underlying theory on which Casey  rested\\u2014that the Four-\\nteenth Amendment\\u2019s Due Process Clause provides  substantive, as well \\nas procedural, protection for \\u201cliberty \\u201d\\u2014has long been controversial.  \\nThe Court\\u2019s decisions have held that the Due Process Clause pro-\\ntects two categories of substantive rights\\u2014those rights guaranteed by\\nthe first eight Amendments to th e Constitution and those rights\\ndeemed fundamental that are not me ntioned anywhere in the Consti-\\ntution. In deciding whether a right fa lls into either of these categories,\\nthe question is whether the right is \\u201cdeeply rooted in [our] history and\\ntradition\\u201d and whether it is essentia l to this Nation\\u2019s \\u201cscheme of or -\\ndered liberty.\\u201d Timbs  v. Indiana , 586 U. S. ___, ___ (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted).  The term \\u201cliberty \\u201d alone provides little guidance. \\nThus, historical inquiries are essent ial whenever the Court is asked to\\nrecognize a new component of the \\u201c liberty\\u201d interest protected by the \\nDue Process Clause. In interpreting what is meant by \\u201cliberty,\\u201d the Court must guard against the natu ral human tendency to confuse \\nwhat the Fourteenth Am endment protects with the Court\\u2019s own ardent\\nviews about the liberty that American s should enjoy.  For this reason, \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   3 Cite as: 597 U.

S. 115, 125. \\nGuided by the history and tradition that map the essential compo-\\nnents of the Nation\\u2019s concept of ordered liberty, the Court finds the \\nFourteenth Amendment clearly does not protect the right to an abor -\\ntion. Until the latter part of the 20t h century, there was no support in \\nAmerican law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion.  No state constitutional provision had recognized  such a right.  Until a few years \\nbefore Roe, no federal or state court had recognized such a right.  Nor \\nhad any scholarly treatise.  Indeed, abortion had long been a crime in \\nevery single State. At common la w, abortion was criminal in at least \\nsome stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could \\nhave very serious consequences at all stages.  American law followed \\nthe common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s ex -\\npanded criminal liability for abortions.  By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three-quarters of the States had made abor -\\ntion a crime at any stage of pregna ncy.  This consensus endured until \\nthe day Roe was decided. Roe either ignored or mi sstated this history, \\nand Casey  declined to reconsider Roe\\u2019s faulty historical analysis.\\nRespondents\\u2019 argument that this history does not matter flies in the \\nface of the standard the Court has applied in determining whether an \\nasserted right that is nowhere ment ioned in the Constitution is never -\\ntheless protected by th e Fourteenth Amendment.  The Solicitor Gen-\\neral repeats Roe\\u2019s claim that it is \\u201cdoubtful . . . abortion was ever firmly \\nestablished as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruc -\\ntion of a quick fetus,\\u201d 410 U. S., at 136, but the great common-law au -\\nthorities\\u2014Bracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstone\\u2014all wrote that a post-\\nquickening abortion was a crime.  Moreover, many authorities as-serted that even a pre-quickening abortion was \\u201cunlawful\\u201d and that,\\nas a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from \\nthe attempt.  The Solicitor General suggests that history supports an\\nabortion right because of the common law\\u2019s failure to criminalize abor-\\ntion before quickening, but the insistence on quickening was not uni-\\nversal, see Mills  v. Commonwealth , 13 Pa. 631, 633; State v. Slagle , 83 \\nN. C. 630, 632, and regardless, the fact that many States in the late \\n18th and early 19th century did no t criminalize pre-quickening abor-\\ntions does not mean that anyone th ought the States lacked the author-\\nity to do so. \\nInstead of seriously pressing th e argument that the abortion right \\nitself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Casey  contend that the \\nabortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right. Roe \\ntermed this a right to privacy, 410 U. S., at 154, and Casey described \\nit as the freedom to make \\u201cintimat e and personal choices\\u201d that are \\n\\u201ccentral to personal dignity and autonomy,\\u201d 505 U. S., at 851.

Roe and Casey  each struck a particular balance between the in -\\nterests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interests of what \\nthey termed \\u201cpotential life.\\u201d  Roe , 410 U. S., at 150; Casey , 505 U. S., \\nat 852. But the people of the vari ous States may evaluate those inter-\\nests differently.  The Nation\\u2019s historical understanding of ordered lib-erty does not prevent the people\\u2019s elected representatives from decid-\\ning how abortion should be regulated.  Pp. 11\\u201330.\\n(3) Finally, the Court considers whether a right to obtain an abor -\\ntion is part of a broader entrenched  right that is supported by other \\nprecedents. The Court concludes the right to obtain an abortion cannot \\nbe justified as a component of such a right.  Attempts to justify abor -\\ntion through appeals to a broader righ t to autonomy and to define one\\u2019s \\n\\u201cconcept of existence\\u201d prove too much.  Casey , 505 U. S., at 851.  Those \\ncriteria, at a high level of generalit y, could license fundamental rights \\nto illicit drug use, pros titution, and the like. What sharply distin-\\nguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on \\nwhich Roe and Casey  rely is something that  both those decisions \\nacknowledged: Abortion is differe nt because it destroys what Roe \\ntermed \\u201cpotential life\\u201d and what the law challenged in this case calls \\nan \\u201cunborn human being.\\u201d  None of the other decisions cited by Roe \\nand Casey  involved the critical moral qu estion posed by abortion.  Ac -\\ncordingly, those cases do not support  the right to obtain an abortion, \\nand the Court\\u2019s conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such \\na right does not undermine them in any way.  Pp. 30\\u201332.\\n(b) The doctrine of stare decisis does not counsel continued ac -\\nceptance of Roe and Casey . Stare decisis  plays an important role and \\nprotects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a \\npast decision.  It \\u201creduces incent ives for challenging settled prece-\\ndents, saving parties and courts th e expense of endless relitigation.\\u201d \\nKimble  v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC , 576 U.

Like the infamous decision in \\nPlessy v. Ferguson , Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision \\ncourse with the Constitution from the day it was decided. Casey per-\\npetuated its errors, calling both sides of the national controversy to \\nresolve their debate,  but in doing so, Casey necessarily declared a win-\\nning side. Those on the losing side\\u2014those who sought to advance the State\\u2019s interest in fetal life\\u2014could no longer seek to persuade theirelected representatives to adopt polic ies consistent with their views. \\nThe Court short-circuited the democra tic process by closing it to the \\nlarge number of Americans who disagreed with Roe. Pp. 43\\u201345. \\n(2) The quality of the reasoning . Without any grounding in the \\nconstitutional text, hi story, or precedent, Roe  imposed on the entire \\ncountry a detailed set of rules for pregnancy divided into trimesters \\nmuch like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation. \\nSee 410 U. S., at 163\\u2013164.  Roe\\u2019s failure even to note the overwhelming \\nconsensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said\\nabout the common law was simply wr ong.  Then, after surveying his -\\ntory, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee, and did not explain why the source s on which it relied sh ed light on the mean -\\ning of the Constitution. As to preced ent, citing a broad array of cases,\\nthe Court found support for a constituti onal \\u201cright of personal privacy.\\u201d \\nId., at 152. But Roe conflated the right to shield information from dis-\\nclosure and the right to make and implement important personal de-\\ncisions without governmental interference. See Whalen  v. Roe, 429 \\nU. S. 589, 599\\u2013600.  None of these decisions involved what is distinc -\\ntive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed \\u201cpotential life.\\u201d \\nWhen the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on\\nthe country, it asserted that its rules were \\u201cconsistent with,\\u201d among\\nother things, \\u201cthe relative weights of  the respective interests involved\\u201d\\nand \\u201cthe demands of the profound problems of the present day.\\u201d  Roe, \\n410 U. S. , at 165.  These are precisely the sort of considerations that \\nlegislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that \\naccommodate competing in terests.  The scheme Roe  produced looked \\nlike legislation, and the Court provid ed the sort of explanation that \\nmight be expected from a legislative body.  An even more glaring defi-\\nciency was Roe\\u2019s failure to justify the critical distinction it drew be-\\ntween pre- and post-viability abortions.  See id., at 163. The arbitrary \\nviability line, which Casey  termed Roe \\u2019s central rule, has not found \\nmuch support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted \\nto justify a right to abortion.  The most obvious problem with any such \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n   6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nSyllabus \\nargument is that viability has changed over time and is heavily de-\\npendent on factors\\u2014such as medica l advances and the availability of\\nquality medical care\\u2014that have nothin g to do with the characteristics\\nof a fetus. \\nWhen Casey revisited Roe almost 20 years later, it reaffirmed Roe\\u2019s \\ncentral holding , but pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its rea-\\nsoning.  The Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and in -\\nstead grounded the abortion right en tirely on the Fourteenth Amend-\\nment\\u2019s Due Process Clause. 505 U. S ., at 846.  The controlling opinion \\ncriticized and rejected Roe \\u2019s trimester scheme, 505 U. S., at 872, and \\nsubstituted a new and obscure \\u201cundue burden\\u201d test.  Casey , in short, \\neither refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roe\\u2019s analy -\\nsis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roe\\u2019s reasoning, endorsed\\nwhat it termed Roe \\u2019s central holding while suggesting that a majority\\nmight not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the abortion right other than Roe\\u2019s status as precedent, and imposed a new \\ntest with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or prece-dent.  Pp. 45\\u201356.\\n(3) Workability .  Deciding whether a precedent should be over-\\nruled depends in part on whether the rule it imposes is workable\\u2014thatis, whether it can be understood an d applied in a consistent and pre-\\ndictable manner. Casey \\u2019s \\u201cundue burden\\u201d test ha s scored poorly on the \\nworkability scale.  The Casey  plurality tried to put meaning into the \\n\\u201cundue burden\\u201d test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these \\nrules created their own problems.  And the difficulty of applying Ca-\\nsey\\u2019s new rules surfaced in that very case.  Compare 505 U. S., at 881\\u2013 \\n887, with id., at 920\\u2013922 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissent-\\ning in part). The experience of th e Courts of Appeals provides further \\nevidence that Casey \\u2019s \\u201cline between\\u201d permissi ble and unconstitutional \\nrestrictions \\u201chas proved to be im possible to draw with precision.\\u201d  Ja-\\nnus, 585 U.

S., at 866\\u2013867.  But the Court cannot allow its de-cisions to be affected by such extr aneous concerns.  A precedent of this \\nCourt is subject to th e usual principles of stare decisis under which \\nadherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command.  If the rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy would still be \\nthe law. The Court\\u2019s job is to interpret the law, apply longstanding\\nprinciples of stare decisis , and decide this case accordingly.  Pp. 66\\u201369.\\n(d)Under the Court\\u2019s precedents, rational-basis review is the appro-\\npriate standard to apply when state abortion regulations undergo con -\\nstitutional challenge.

S., at 729\\u2013730.  That applies even when the laws at issue con -\\ncern matters of great social significance and moral substance.

JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S \\nHEALTH ORGANIZATION, ET AL . \\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \\nAPPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT \\n[June 24, 2022] \\nJUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court. \\nAbortion presents a profound moral issue on which Amer-\\nicans hold sharply conflicting vi ews.  Some believe fervently \\nthat a human person comes into being at conception and \\nthat abortion ends an innocent life.  Others feel just as\\nstrongly that any regulation of abortion invades a woman\\u2019sright to control her own body and prevents women from \\nachieving full equality.  Still others in a third group think \\nthat abortion should be allowe d under some but not all cir-\\ncumstances, and those within this group hold a variety of views about the particular restrictions that should be im-posed.\\nFor the first 185 years after the adoption of the Constitu-\\ntion, each State was permitted to address this issue in ac -\\ncordance with the views of its citizens.  Then, in 1973, this Court decided Roe v. Wade , 410 U. S. 113. Even though the \\nConstitution makes no mentio n of abortion, the Court held \\nthat it confers a broad right to obtain one.  It did not claim that American law or the common law had ever recognized \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n  2 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nOpinion of the Court \\nsuch a right, and its survey of history ranged from the con -\\nstitutionally irrelevant (e.g ., its discussion of abortion in an-\\ntiquity) to the plainly incorrect ( e.g., its assertion that abor-\\ntion was probably never a crime under the common law). \\nAfter cataloging a wealth of other information having nobearing on the meaning of the Constitution, the opinion \\nconcluded with a numbered set of rules much like those that \\nmight be found in a statute enacted by a legislature.\\nUnder this scheme, each trimester of pregnancy was reg-\\nulated differently, but the most critical line was drawn atroughly the end of the second trimester, which, at the time,\\ncorresponded to the point at which a fetus was thought to\\nachieve \\u201cviability,\\u201d i.e., the ability to survive outside the\\nwomb. Although the Court acknowledged that States had a legitimate interest in protecting \\u201cpotential life,\\u201d\\n1 it found \\nthat this interest could not justify any restriction on pre-\\nviability abortions. The Court did not explain the basis for \\nthis line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard\\nto defend Roe\\u2019s reasoning. One prominent constitutional \\nscholar wrote that he \\u201cwould vote for a statute very much\\nlike the one the Court end[ed] up drafting\\u201d if he were \\u201calegislator,\\u201d but his assessment of Roe was memorable and \\nbrutal: Roe was \\u201cnot constitutional law\\u201d at all and gave \\u201cal-\\nmost no sense of an obligation to try to be.\\u201d\\n2 \\nAt the time of Roe , 30 States still prohibited abortion at \\nall stages. In the years prior to that decision, about a third\\nof the States had liberalized their laws, but Roe abruptly \\nended that political process.  It imposed the same highly restrictive regime on the entire Nation, and it effectivelystruck down the abortion laws of every single State.\\n3  As \\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 \\n1 Roe v.

S. 833 (1992), the Court revisited Roe , but the \\nMembers of the Court split three ways.  Two Justices ex-pressed no desire to change Roe in any way.\\n5 Four others \\nwanted to overrule the decision in its entirety.6  And the \\nthree remaining Justices, who jointly signed the controlling opinion, took a third position.\\n7  Their opinion did not en-\\ndorse Roe\\u2019s reasoning, and it even hinted that one or more\\nof its authors might have \\u201creservations\\u201d about whether the\\nConstitution protects a right to abortion.8 But the opinion\\nconcluded that stare decisis , which calls for prior decisions \\nto be followed in most instances, required adherence to\\nwhat it called Roe \\u2019s \\u201ccentral holding\\u201d\\u2014that a State may not \\nconstitutionally protect fetal lif e before \\u201cviability\\u201d\\u2014even if\\nthat holding was wrong.9 Anything less, the opinion\\nclaimed, would undermine resp ect for this Court and the \\nrule of law. \\nParadoxically, the judgment in Casey did a fair amount \\nof overruling.

But the three Justices who \\nauthored the controlling opinion \\u201ccall[ed] the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national divi-\\nsion\\u201d by treating the Court\\u2019s decision as the final settlement\\nof the question of the constitutional right to abortion.\\n12 \\nAs has become increasingly apparent in the intervening \\nyears, Casey  did not achieve that goal.  Americans continue \\nto hold passionate and widely divergent views on abortion,and state legislatures have acted accordingly. Some have recently enacted laws allowing abortion, with few re -\\nstrictions, at all stages of pregnancy.  Others have tightlyrestricted abortion beginning we ll before viability.  And in \\nthis case, 26 States have expressly asked this Court to over-rule Roe and Casey  and allow the States to regulate or pro -\\nhibit pre-viability abortions.\\nBefore us now is one such state law.

They tell us that \\u201cno half-measures\\u201d are available: We must either reaffirm or over -\\nrule Roe and Casey . Brief for Respondents 50. \\nII \\nWe begin by considering the critical question whether the \\nConstitution, properly understood, confers a right to obtainan abortion.  Skipping over t hat question, the controlling \\nopinion in Casey  reaffirmed Roe\\u2019s \\u201ccentral holding\\u201d based \\nsolely on the doctrine of stare decisis , but as we will explain, \\nproper application of stare decisis required an assessment \\nof the strength of the grounds on which Roe was based. See \\ninfra,  at 45\\u201356. \\nWe therefore turn to the question that the Casey  plurality\\ndid not consider, and we address that question in three steps. First, we explain the standard that our cases haveused in determining whether the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s \\nreference to \\u201cliberty\\u201d protects a particular right.  Second, \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n 9 Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) \\nOpinion of the Court \\nwe examine whether the right at issue in this case is rooted \\nin our Nation\\u2019s history and tradition and whether it is an\\nessential component of what we  have described as \\u201cordered\\nliberty.\\u201d Finally, we consider whether a right to obtain an \\nabortion is part of a broader entrenched right that is sup-\\nported by other precedents. \\nA \\n1 \\nConstitutional analysis must begin with \\u201cthe language of \\nthe instrument,\\u201d Gibbons  v. Ogden , 9 Wheat. 1, 186\\u2013189 \\n(1824), which offers a \\u201cfixed standard\\u201d for ascertaining\\nwhat our founding document means, 1 J. Story, Commen-\\ntaries on the Constitution of the United States \\u00a7399, p. 383(1833). The Constitution makes no express reference to a \\nright to obtain an abortion, and therefore those who claim \\nthat it protects such a right must show that the right is\\nsomehow implicit in the constitutional text. \\nRoe, however, was remarkably loose in its treatment of\\nthe constitutional text.  It he ld that the abortion right,\\nwhich is not mentioned in the Constitution, is part of a right \\nto privacy, which is also not mentioned. See 410 U. S., at \\n152\\u2013153. And that privacy right, Roe observed, had been \\nfound to spring from no fewe r than five different constitu-\\ntional provisions\\u2014the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Id., at 152. \\nThe Court\\u2019s discussion left open at least three ways in\\nwhich some combination of these provisions could protect \\nthe abortion right. One possibility was that the right was \\n\\u201cfounded . . . in the Ninth Amendment\\u2019s reservation of \\nrights to the people.\\u201d  Id., at 153.  Another was that the \\nright was rooted in the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendment, \\nor in some combination of th ose provisions, and that this\\nright had been \\u201cincorporated\\u201d into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment just as many other Bill of\\nRights provisions had by then been incorporated.  Ibid; see \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  10 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nOpinion of the Court \\nalso McDonald v. Chicago , 561 U. S. 742, 763\\u2013766 (2010) \\n(majority opinion) (discussing incorporation).  And a third \\npath was that the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments played no role and that the right was simply a component \\nof the \\u201cliberty\\u201d protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s \\nDue Process Clause. Roe, 410 U. S., at 153. Roe expressed \\nthe \\u201cfeel[ing]\\u201d that the Fourteenth Amendment was the pro-vision that did the work, but its message seemed to be that the abortion right could be found somewhere in the Consti-\\ntution and that specifying its exact location was not of par-amount importance.\\n16 The Casey  Court did not defend this \\nunfocused analysis and instead grounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an abortion is part of\\nthe \\u201cliberty\\u201d protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s Due \\nProcess Clause. \\nWe discuss this theory in depth below, but before doing \\nso, we briefly address one addi tional constitutional provi-\\nsion that some of respondents\\u2019 amici have now offered as \\nyet another potential home for the abortion right: the Four-\\nteenth Amendment\\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae  24 (Brief for United \\nStates); see also Brief for Equal Protection Constitutional Law Scholars as Amici Curiae. Neither Roe nor Casey saw \\nfit to invoke this theory, and it  is squarely foreclosed by our \\nprecedents, which establish that a State\\u2019s regulation of \\nabortion is not a sex-based classification and is thus not \\nsubject to the \\u201cheightened scru tiny\\u201d that applies to such \\nclassifications.\\n17  The regulation of a medical procedure that \\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 \\n16The Court\\u2019s words were as follows: \\u201cThis right of privacy, whether it \\nbe founded in the Fourteenth Amendm ent\\u2019s concept of personal liberty \\nand restrictions upon state action, as we  feel it is, or, as the District Court \\ndetermined, in the Ninth Amendment\\u2019s reservation of rights to the peo-\\nple, is broad enough to  encompass a woman\\u2019s decision whether or not to\\nterminate her pregnancy.\\u201d  410 U. S., at 153. \\n17See, e.g., Sessions v. Morales-Santana , 582 U. S. 47, ___ (2017) (slip \\nop., at 8). \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  11 Cite as: 597 U.

Aiello , 417 \\nU. S. 484, 496, n. 20 (1974).  And as the Court has stated, \\nthe \\u201cgoal of preventing abortion\\u201d does not constitute \\u201cinvid -\\niously discriminatory animus\\u201d against women. Bray  v. Al-\\nexandria Women\\u2019s Health Clinic , 506 U. S. 263, 273\\u2013274 \\n(1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly,laws regulating or prohibiting abortion are not subject to heightened scrutiny. Rather, they are governed by the\\nsame standard of review as other health and safety \\nmeasures.\\n18 \\nWith this new theory addressed, we turn to Casey \\u2019s bold \\nassertion that the abortion right is an aspect of the \\u201cliberty\\u201dprotected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \\nAmendment. 505 U. S., at 846; Brief for Respondents 17; \\nBrief for United States 21\\u201322. \\n2 \\nThe underlying theory on which this argument rests\\u2014\\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s Due Process Clause pro-\\nvides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for \\u201clib-\\nerty\\u201d\\u2014has long been controversial.  But our decisions have \\nheld that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of \\nsubstantive rights.\\nThe first consists of rights guaranteed by the first eight\\nAmendments. Those Amendments originally applied onlyto the Federal Government, Barron ex rel. Tiernan  v. Mayor \\nof Baltimore , 7 Pet. 243, 247\\u2013251 (1833) (opinion for the\\nCourt by Marshall, C. J.), but this Court has held that the \\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \\u201cincor-\\nporates\\u201d the great majority of those rights and thus makes them equally applicable to the States. See McDonald, 561 \\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 \\n18We discuss this standard in Part VI of this opinion. \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   12 DOBBS v.

The second category\\u2014\\nwhich is the one in question here\\u2014comprises a select list of \\nfundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. \\nIn deciding whether a right falls into either of these cat-\\negories, the Court has long asked whether the right is\\n\\u201cdeeply rooted in [our] history and tradition\\u201d and whether \\nit is essential to our Nation\\u2019s \\u201cscheme of ordered liberty.\\u201d Timbs  v.

No state constitutional provision had recog-\\nnized such a right.  Until a few years before Roe  was handed \\ndown, no federal or state court had recognized such a right.\\nNor had any scholarly treatise of which we are aware.  And \\nalthough law review articles are not reticent about advocat-\\ning new rights, the earliest article proposing a constitu-\\ntional right to abortion that has come to our attention was \\npublished only a few years before Roe.23 \\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 \\n22That is true regardless of whethe r we look to the Amendment\\u2019s Due \\nProcess Clause or its Pr ivileges or Immunities Clause. Some scholars \\nand Justices have mainta ined that the Privileges or Immunities Clause \\nis the provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that gu arantees substan -\\ntive rights. See, e.g., McDonald  v. Chicago , 561 U. S. 742, 813\\u2013850 \\n(2010) (T HOMAS , J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Dun-\\ncan, 391 U.

Crosskey, Politics and the Constitution in the History of the United States 1089\\u20131095 (1953).  But even on that view, such a right would need to be rooted in the Nation\\u2019s history and \\ntradition. See Corfield  v. Coryell, 6 F.

JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nOpinion of the Court \\nNot only was there no support for such a constitutional \\nright until shortly before Roe, but abortion had long been a \\ncrime in every single State. At common law, abortion was \\ncriminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was re-\\ngarded as unlawful and could have very serious conse-\\nquences at all stages. American law followed the common \\nlaw until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s ex -\\npanded criminal liability for abortions.  By the time of the\\nadoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three-quarters of \\nthe States had made abortion a crime at any stage of preg -\\nnancy, and the remaining States would soon follow. \\nRoe either ignored or misstated this history, and Casey\\ndeclined to reconsider Roe\\u2019s faulty historical analysis. It is \\ntherefore important to set the record straight. \\n2 \\na \\nWe begin with the common law, under which abortion\\nwas a crime at least after \\u201cquickening\\u201d\\u2014i.e. , the first felt \\nmovement of the fetus in the womb, which usually occursbetween the 16th and 18t h week of pregnancy.\\n24 \\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 \\narticulate on paper\\u201d the argument that \\u201ca woman\\u2019s right to choose abor -\\ntion was a fundamental individual fr eedom protected by the U. S. Con-\\nstitution\\u2019s guarantee of  personal liberty\\u201d). \\n24The exact meaning of \\u201cquickening\\u201d is subject to some debate.  Com-\\npare Brief for Scholars of Jurisprudence as Amici Curiae  12\\u201314, and \\nn. 32 (emphasis deleted) (\\u201c \\u2018a quick child\\u2019 \\u201d meant simply a \\u201clive\\u201d child, \\nand under the era\\u2019s outd ated knowledge of em bryology, a fetus was \\nthought to become \\u201cquick\\u201d at around the sixth week of pregnancy), with \\nBrief for American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae  6, n. 2 \\n(\\u201cquick\\u201d and \\u201cquickening\\u201d consistently meant \\u201cthe woman\\u2019s perception of \\nfetal movement\\u201d).  We need not wade in to this debate.  First, it suffices \\nfor present purposes to show that abortion was criminal by at least the \\n16th or 18th week of pregnancy.  Second, as we will show, during the relevant period\\u2014 i.e., the period surrounding the enactment of the Four-\\nteenth Amendment\\u2014the quickening distinction was abandoned as States criminalized abortion at a ll stages of pregnancy.

Cf. Glucksberg , 521 U. S., at 713 (removal of \\u201ccom-\\nmon law\\u2019s harsh sanctions did not represent an acceptance \\nof suicide\\u201d). Quite to the contrary, in the 1732 case men-\\ntioned above, the judge said of the charge of abortion (with no mention of quickening) that he had \\u201cnever met with a \\ncase so barbarous and unnatural.\\u201d\\n28 Similarly, an indict-\\nment from 1602, which did not distinguish between a pre-quickening and post-quickening abortion, described abor-\\ntion as \\u201cpernicious\\u201d and \\u201cagainst the peace of our Lady the Queen, her crown and dignity.\\u201d  Keown 7 (discussing R. v. \\nWebb, Calendar of Assize Records, Surrey Indictments 512(1980)).\\nThat the common law did not condone even pre-\\nquickening abortions is confirmed by what one might call aproto-felony-murder rule.  Hale  and Blackstone explained a \\nway in which a pre-quickening abortion could rise to the level of a homicide.  Hale wrote that if a physician gave a \\nwoman \\u201cwith child \\u201d a \\u201cpotion\\u201d to cause an abortion, and the \\nwoman died, it was \\u201cmurder\\u201d because the potion was given \\u201cunlawfully  to destroy her child within her.\\u201d 1 Hale 429\\u2013 \\n430 (emphasis added).

In the case of an abortionist, Black-stone wrote, \\u201cthe law will imply [malice]\\u201d for the same rea-\\nson that it would imply malice if a person who intended to \\nkill one person accidentally killed a different person: \\n\\u201c[I]f one shoots at A and misses him, but kills B, this is \\nmurder; because of the previous felonious intent, whichthe law transfers from one to the other. The same is the case, where one lays poison for A; and B, against \\nwhom the prisoner had no malicious intent, takes it, \\nand it kills him; this is likewise murder.  So also , if one \\ngives a woman with child a medicine to procure abor-\\ntion, and it operates so violently as to kill the woman, \\nthis is murder in the person who gave it.\\u201d Id., at 200\\u2013 \\n201 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).\\n29 \\nNotably, Blackstone, like Hale, did not state that this \\nproto-felony-murder rule required that the woman be \\u201cwith\\nquick child\\u201d\\u2014only that she be \\u201cwith child.\\u201d  Id., at 201.  And \\nit is revealing that Hale and Blackstone treated abortion-ists differently from other physicians or surgeons who\\ncaused the death of a patient \\u201cwithout any intent of doing [the patient] any bodily hurt.\\u201d Hale 429; see 4 Blackstone 197. These other physicians\\u2014even if \\u201cunlicensed\\u201d\\u2014would\\nnot be \\u201cguilty of murder or m anslaughter.\\u201d Hale 429.

JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nOpinion of the Court \\nlate 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-\\nquickening abortions does not mean that anyone thought \\nthe States lacked the authority to do so.  When legislatures began to exercise that authority as the century wore on, no\\none, as far as we are aware, argued that the laws they en-\\nacted violated a fundamental right. That is not surprising\\nsince common-law authorities had repeatedly condemned \\nabortion and described it as an \\u201cunlawful\\u201d act without re-gard to whether it occurred befo re or after quickening.  See \\nsupra, at 16\\u201321. \\nAnother amicus  brief relied upon by respondents (see\\nBrief for Respondents 21) tries to dismiss the significanceof the state criminal statutes that were in effect when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted by suggesting that \\nthey were enacted for illegitima te reasons. According to\\nthis account, which is based almost entirely on statementsmade by one prominent proponent of the statutes, im-\\nportant motives for the laws were the fear that Catholic im-migrants were having more babies than Protestants and \\nthat the availability of abortion was leading White\\nProtestant women to \\u201cshir[k their] maternal duties.\\u201d  Brief \\nfor American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae \\n20. \\nResort to this argument is a testament to the lack of any\\nreal historical support for the right that Roe and Casey  rec-\\nognized. This Court has long disfavored arguments based on alleged legislative motives.  See, e.g., Erie v. Pap\\u2019s A. M., \\n529 U.

S. ____ (2022) \\nOpinion of the Court \\nhave been reluctant to attribut e those motives to the legis-\\nlative body as a whole.  \\u201cWhat motivates one legislator to \\nmake a speech about a statute is not necessarily what mo -\\ntivates scores of others to enact it.\\u201d Id., at 384. \\nHere, the argument about legi slative motive is not even \\nbased on statements by legislators, but on statements made\\nby a few supporters of the new 19th-century abortion laws, \\nand it is quite a leap to attribute these motives to all the legislators whose votes were responsible for the enactment \\nof those laws.  Recall that at the time of the adoption of the \\nFourteenth Amendment, over three-quarters of the States \\nhad adopted statutes criminalizing abortion (usually at all \\nstages of pregnancy), and that from the early 20th century until the day Roe  was handed down, every single State had\\nsuch a law on its books. Are we to believe that the hundreds of lawmakers whose votes were needed to enact these laws \\nwere motivated by hostility to Catholics and women? \\nThere is ample evidence that the passage of these laws \\nwas instead spurred by a sincere belief that abortion kills ahuman being. Many judicial decisions from the late 19th \\nand early 20th centuries made that point.  See, e.g. , Nash \\nv. Meyer , 54 Idaho 283, 301, 31 P. 2d 273, 280 (1934); State \\nv.

Glucksberg , 521 U. S., at 721; cf. Timbs , \\n586 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).  But despite the dissent\\u2019s professed fidelity to stare decisis , it fails to seriously engage\\nwith that important precedent\\u2014which it cannot possibly \\nsatisfy.\\nThe dissent attempts to obsc ure this failure by misrepre -\\nsenting our application of Glucksberg. The dissent suggests\\nthat we have focused only on \\u201cthe legal status of abortion in the 19th century,\\u201d post, at 26, but our review of this Na-\\ntion\\u2019s tradition extends well past that period.  As explained, \\nfor more than a century after 1868\\u2014including \\u201canother \\nhalf-century\\u201d after women gained  the constitutional right \\nto vote in 1920, see post, at 15; Amdt. 19\\u2014it was firmly es -\\ntablished that laws prohibiting abortion like the Texas law\\nat issue in Roe were permissible exercises of state regula-\\ntory authority.  And today, ano ther half century later, more\\nthan half of the States have asked us to overrule Roe and \\nCasey. The dissent cannot establish that a right to abortion \\nhas ever been part of this Nation\\u2019s tradition. \\n2 \\nBecause the dissent cannot argue that the abortion right \\nis rooted in this Nation\\u2019s history and tradition, it contends\\nthat the \\u201cconstitutional tradition\\u201d is \\u201cnot captured whole at\\na single moment,\\u201d and that its \\u201cmeaning gains content fromthe long sweep of our history and from successive judicial \\nprecedents.\\u201d Post, at 18 (internal quotation marks omit-\\nted). This vague formulation imposes no clear restraints on what Justice White called the \\u201cexercise of raw judicial \\npower,\\u201d Roe, 410 U.

S. ____ (2022) \\nOpinion of the Court \\nanything goes,\\u201d post, at 17, any real restraints are hard to \\ndiscern. \\nThe largely limitless reach of  the dissenters\\u2019 standard is\\nillustrated by the way they apply it here.  First, if the \\u201clongsweep of history\\u201d imposes any restraint on the recognition\\nof unenumerated rights, then Roe was surely wrong, since \\nabortion was never allowed (except to save the life of the mother) in a majority of States for over 100 years before that decision was handed down. Second, it is impossible to \\ndefend Roe based on prior precedent because all of the prec-\\nedents Roe cited, including Griswold and Eisenstadt , were \\ncritically different for a reason that we have explained:\\nNone of those cases involved the destruction of what Roe \\ncalled \\u201cpotential life.\\u201d See supra, at 32. \\nSo without support in history or relevant precedent, Roe\\u2019s \\nreasoning cannot be defended even under the dissent\\u2019s pro-posed test, and the dissent is force d to rely solely on the fact\\nthat a constitutional right to  abortion was recognized in Roe \\nand later decisions that accepted Roe\\u2019s interpretation. Un-\\nder the doctrine of stare decisis , those precedents are enti-\\ntled to careful and respectful consideration, and we engagein that analysis below. But as the Court has reiterated time \\nand time again, adherence to precedent is not \\u201c \\u2018an inexora-\\nble command.\\u2019 \\u201d  Kimble  v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC , 576 \\nU. S. 446, 455 (2015). There are occasions when past deci-\\nsions should be overruled, and as we will explain, this is one \\nof them. \\n3 \\nThe most striking feature of the dissent is the absence of\\nany serious discussion of the legitimacy of the States\\u2019 inter-est in protecting fetal life. This is evident in the analogythat the dissent draws between the abortion right and the\\nrights recognized in Griswold (contraception), Eisenstadt \\n(same), Lawrence (sexual conduct with member of the same \\nsex), and Obergefell (same-sex marriage).  Perhaps this is \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n 38 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nOpinion of the Court \\ndesigned to stoke unfounded fear that our decision will im -\\nperil those other rights, but the dissent\\u2019s analogy is objec-tionable for a more important reason: what it reveals about the dissent\\u2019s views on the protection of what Roe called \\u201cpo-\\ntential life.\\u201d The exercise of the rights at issue in Griswold , \\nEisenstadt , Lawrence , and Obergefell does not destroy a \\u201cpo-\\ntential life,\\u201d but an abortion has that effect.  So if the rightsat issue in those cases are fundamentally the same as the \\nright recognized in Roe  and Casey , the implication is clear: \\nThe Constitution does not permit the States to regard the destruction of a \\u201cpotential life\\u201d as a matter of any signifi-\\ncance. \\nThat view is evident throughout the dissent.  The dissent \\nhas much to say about the effects of pregnancy on women,\\nthe burdens of motherhood, and the difficulties faced by poor women.  These are import ant concerns.  However, the \\ndissent evinces no similar regard for a State\\u2019s interest in protecting prenatal life.  The dissent repeatedly praises the \\n\\u201cbalance,\\u201d post, at 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, that the viability line\\nstrikes between a woman\\u2019s liberty interest and the State\\u2019s \\ninterest in prenatal life.  But for reasons we discuss later, \\nsee infra,  at 50\\u201354, 55\\u201356, and given in the opinion of T\\nHE \\nCHIEF JUSTICE , post, at 2\\u20135 (opinion concurring in judg-\\nment), the viability line makes no sense.  It was not ade-\\nquately justified in Roe, and the dissent does not even try \\nto defend it today. Nor does it identify any other point in a pregnancy after which a State is permitted to prohibit the\\ndestruction of a fetus. \\nOur opinion is not based on any view about if and when\\nprenatal life is entitled to any of the rights enjoyed after birth. The dissent, by contrast, would impose on the people\\na particular theory about when the rights of personhoodbegin. According to the dissent, the Constitution requires\\nthe States to regard a fetus as lacking even the most basichuman right\\u2014to live\\u2014at least until an arbitrary point in a \\npregnancy has passed.

In Part II, \\nsupra, we explained why Roe was incorrectly decided, but \\nthat decision was more than just wrong.  It stood on excep-\\ntionally weak grounds. Roe found that the Constitution implicitly conferred a\\nright to obtain an abortion, but it failed to ground its deci-sion in text, history, or precedent.  It relied on an erroneous \\nhistorical narrative; it devote d great attention to and pre-\\nsumably relied on matters that have no bearing on the meaning of the Constitution; it disregarded the fundamen -\\ntal difference between the precedents on which it relied and \\nthe question before the Court; it concocted an elaborate set\\nof rules, with different res trictions for each trimester of \\npregnancy, but it did not explain how this veritable code \\ncould be teased out of anything in the Constitution, the his-\\ntory of abortion laws, prior precedent, or any other citedsource; and its most important rule (that States cannot pro-\\ntect fetal life prior to \\u201cviability\\u201d) was never raised by any \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n 46 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nOpinion of the Court \\nparty and has never been plausibly explained.  Roe\\u2019s rea-\\nsoning quickly drew scathing scholarly criticism, even from \\nsupporters of broad access to abortion. \\nThe Casey plurality, while reaffirming Roe\\u2019s central hold -\\ning, pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its reason-\\ning. It revised the textual bas is for the abortion right, si-\\nlently abandoned Roe\\u2019s erroneous historical narrative, and \\njettisoned the trimester framework.  But it replaced that\\nscheme with an arbitrary \\u201cundue burden\\u201d test and relied on\\nan exceptional version of stare decisis that, as explained be -\\nlow, this Court had never before applied and has never in-voked since. \\n1 \\na \\nThe weaknesses in Roe\\u2019s reasoning are well-known. \\nWithout any grounding in the constitutional text, history, \\nor precedent, it imposed on the entire country a detailed set of rules much like those that one might expect to find in a \\nstatute or regulation. See 410 U. S., at 163\\u2013164.  Dividing\\npregnancy into three trimesters, the Court imposed special \\nrules for each. During the first trimester, the Court an-\\nnounced, \\u201cthe abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman\\u2019s at-\\ntending physician.\\u201d Id., at 164. After that point, a State\\u2019s\\ninterest in regulating abortion  for the sake of a woman\\u2019s\\nhealth became compelling, and accordingly, a State could \\n\\u201cregulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasona-bly related to maternal health.\\u201d Ibid. Finally, in \\u201cthe stage\\nsubsequent to viability,\\u201d which in 1973 roughly coincided with the beginning of the third trimester, the State\\u2019s inter-\\nest in \\u201cthe potentiality of human life\\u201d became compelling, \\nand therefore a State could \\u201cregulate, and even proscribe,abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medi-\\ncal judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the\\nmother.\\u201d Id., at 164\\u2013165. \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n 47 Cite as: 597 U.

This erroneous understanding appears to \\nhave played an important part in the Court\\u2019s thinking be-cause the opinion cited \\u201cthe lenity of the common law\\u201d as \\none of the four factors that informed its decision. Id., at \\n165. \\nAfter surveying history, the opinion spent many para-\\ngraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be un -\\ndertaken by a legislative committee. This included a lengthy account of the \\u201cposition of the American Medical\\nAssociation\\u201d and \\u201c[t]he position of the American Public \\nHealth Association,\\u201d as well as the vote by the American\\nBar Association\\u2019s House of Delegates in February 1972 onproposed abortion legislation.

But the Court did not explain why mortality rates\\nwere the only factor that a State could legitimately con-\\nsider. Many health and safety regulations aim to avoid ad-\\nverse health consequences short of death.

The definition of a \\u201cviable\\u201d fetus is one that is capable of surviving outside the womb, but why is this the point at \\nwhich the State\\u2019s interest becomes compelling? If, as Roe \\nheld, a State\\u2019s interest in prote cting prenatal life is compel-\\nling \\u201cafter viability,\\u201d 410 U.

Due to \\nthe development of new equipm ent and improved practices, \\nthe viability line has changed over the years. In the 19th \\ncentury, a fetus may not have been viable until the 32d or \\n33d week of pregnancy or even later.51  When Roe was de-\\ncided, viability was gauged at roughly 28 weeks. See 410 U. S., at 160.  Today, respondents draw the line at 23 or 24 \\nweeks. Brief for Respondents 8. So, according to Roe\\u2019s logic,\\nStates now have a compelling inte rest in protecting a fetus\\nwith a gestational age of, say, 26 weeks, but in 1973 States did not have an interest in protecting an identical fetus.\\nHow can that be? \\nViability also depends on the \\u201cquality of the available\\nmedical facilities.\\u201d Colautti  v. Franklin , 439 U. S. 379, 396 \\n(1979). Thus, a 24-week-old fetus may be viable if a woman\\ngives birth in a city with hospitals that provide advanced \\ncare for very premature babies, but if the woman travels to \\na remote area far from any such hospital, the fetus may no\\nlonger be viable.

The Court \\nabandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth \\nAmendment\\u2019s Due Process Clause. 505 U. S., at 846.  The \\nCourt did not reaffirm Roe\\u2019s erroneous account of abortion \\nhistory. In fact, none of the Justices in the majority said\\nanything about the history of the abortion right.

Huge burdens are plainly \\u201csubstantial,\\u201dand trivial ones are not, but in between these extremes, \\nthere is a wide gray area. \\nThis ambiguity is a problem, and the second rule, which \\napplies at all stages of a preg nancy, muddies things further.\\nIt states that measures designed \\u201cto ensure that the \\nwoman\\u2019s choice is informed\\u201d are constitutional so long as\\nthey do not impose \\u201can undue burden on the right.\\u201d Casey , \\n505 U.

In Casey , the controlling opinion conceded \\nthat those traditional reliance interests were not implicated\\nbecause getting an abortion is generally \\u201cunplanned activ-\\nity,\\u201d and \\u201creproductive planning could take virtually imme-\\ndiate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions.\\u201d 505 U.

For these reasons, we \\nagree with the Casey plurality that conventional, concrete\\nreliance interests are not present here. \\n2 \\nUnable to find reliance in the conventional sense, the con-\\ntrolling opinion in Casey perceived a more intangible form\\nof reliance.  It wrote that \\u201cpeople [had] organized intimate \\nrelationships and made choices that define their views of\\nthemselves and their places in society . . . in reliance on the \\navailability of abortion in the event that contraceptionshould fail\\u201d and that \\u201c[t]he ability of women to participate \\nequally in the economic and social life of the Nation has \\nbeen facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive \\nlives.\\u201d Ibid.

That form of reliance depends on an em-\\npirical question that is hard for anyone\\u2014and in particular, for a court\\u2014to assess, namely, the effect of the abortion \\nright on society and in particular on the lives of women.\\nThe contending sides in this case make impassioned and \\nconflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right\\non the lives of women.

The \\ncontending sides also make conflicting arguments about thestatus of the fetus.  This Court has neither the authority\\nnor the expertise to adjudicate those disputes, and the Ca-\\nsey plurality\\u2019s speculations and weighing of the relative im-\\nportance of the fetus and mother represent a departure\\nfrom the \\u201coriginal constitutional proposition\\u201d that \\u201ccourtsdo not substitute their social  and economic beliefs for the \\njudgment of legislative bodies.\\u201d  Ferguson v.

As even the \\nCasey plurality recognized, \\u201c[a]bortion is a unique act\\u201d be-\\ncause it terminates \\u201clife or potential life.\\u201d  505 U. S., at 852; \\nsee also Roe , 410 U.

S., at 869. \\nThis analysis starts out on the right foot but ultimately \\nveers off course.  The Casey  plurality was certainly right\\nthat it is important for the public to perceive that our deci-\\nsions are based on principle, and we should make every ef-\\nfort to achieve that objective by issuing opinions that care -\\nfully show how a proper understanding of the law leads tothe results we reach. But we cannot exceed the scope of our authority under the Constituti on, and we cannot allow our \\ndecisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public\\u2019s reaction to our work. Cf. \\nTexas  v. Johnson , 491 U. S. 397 (1989); Brown , 347 U. S. \\n483. That is true both when we initially decide a constitu-\\ntional issue and when we consider whether to overrule a \\nprior decision. As Chief Justi ce Rehnquist explained, \\u201cThe \\nJudicial Branch derives its legitimacy, not from following public opinion, but from deciding by its best lights whether \\nlegislative enactments of the popular branches of Govern-\\nment comport with the Constitution.  The doctrine of stare \\ndecisis is an adjunct of this duty, and should be no more \\nsubject to the vagaries of public opinion than is the basic\\njudicial task.\\u201d Casey , 505 U. S., at 963 (opinion concurring \\nin judgment in part and dissenting in part).  In suggesting\\notherwise, the Casey  plurality went beyond this Court\\u2019s role\\nin our constitutional system.\\nThe Casey plurality \\u201ccall[ed] the contending sides of a na-\\ntional controversy to end th eir national division,\\u201d and \\nclaimed the authority to impose a permanent settlement of \\nthe issue of a constitutional abortion right simply by saying \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n 68 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nOpinion of the Court \\nthat the matter was closed.  Id., at 867. That unprece-\\ndented claim exceeded the power vested in us by the Con-\\nstitution. As Alexander Hamilton famously put it, the Con -\\nstitution gives the judiciary \\u201cneither Force nor Will.\\u201d  The \\nFederalist No. 78, p. 523 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  Our sole au-thority is to exercise \\u201cjudgment\\u201d\\u2014which is to say, the au-\\nthority to judge what the law means and how it should ap-\\nply to the case at hand.  Ibid. The Court has no authority \\nto decree that an erroneous precedent is permanently  ex-\\nempt from evaluation under traditional stare decisis  princi -\\nples.  A precedent of this Cou rt is subject to the usual prin-\\nciples of stare decisis under which adherence to precedent \\nis the norm but not an inexorable command. If the rule \\nwere otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy  and Loch-\\nner would still be the law. That is not how stare decisis  op-\\nerates. \\nThe Casey  plurality also misjudged the practical limits of\\nthis Court\\u2019s influence.  Roe certainly did not succeed in end -\\ning division on the issue of abortion. On the contrary, Roe \\n\\u201cinflamed\\u201d a national issue that has remained bitterly divi-\\nsive for the past half century. Casey , 505 U. S., at 995 (opin-\\nion of Scalia, J.); see also R. Ginsburg, Speaking in a Judi-\\ncial Voice, 67 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1185, 1208 (1992) (Roe  may \\nhave \\u201chalted a political process,\\u201d \\u201cprolonged divisiveness,\\u201d and \\u201cdeferred stable settlement of the issue\\u201d). And for the \\npast 30 years, Casey  has done the same. \\nNeither decision has ended debate over the issue of a \\nconstitutional right to obtain an abortion.  Indeed, in this case, 26 States expressly ask us to overrule Roe and Casey\\nand to return the issue of abortion to the people and theirelected representatives. This Court\\u2019s inability to end de-\\nbate on the issue should not have been surprising.  This Court cannot bring about the permanent resolution of a rancorous national controversy simply by dictating a settle-\\nment and telling the people to move on.  Whatever influence \\nthe Court may have on public attitudes must stem from the \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n 69 Cite as: 597 U.

S., at 222 (White, J., dissent-\\ning).\\nWe do not pretend to know how our political system or\\nsociety will respond to today\\u2019s decision overruling Roe and \\nCasey .  And even if we could foresee what will happen, we\\nwould have no authority to let that knowledge influence our \\ndecision. We can only do our job, which is to interpret the \\nlaw, apply longstanding principles of stare decisis , and de-\\ncide this case accordingly.\\nWe therefore hold that the Constitution does not confer a \\nright to abortion. Roe and Casey  must be overruled, and the \\nauthority to regulate abortion must be returned to the peo-\\nple and their elected representatives. \\nV A \\n1 \\nThe dissent argues that we have \\u201cabandon[ed]\\u201d stare de-\\ncisis, post, at 30, but we have done no such thing, and it is\\nthe dissent\\u2019s understanding of stare decisis  that breaks \\nwith tradition.  The dissent\\u2019s foundational contention is \\nthat the Court should never (or perhaps almost never) over-\\nrule an egregiously wrong cons titutional precedent unless \\nthe Court can \\u201cpoin[t] to major legal or factual changes un-\\ndermining [the] decision\\u2019s original basis.\\u201d  Post, at 37. To \\nsupport this contention, the dissent claims that Brown v. \\nBoard of Education, 347 U. S. 483, and other landmark \\ncases overruling prior preced ents \\u201cresponded to changed \\nlaw and to changed facts and attitudes that had taken hold \\nthroughout society.\\u201d Post,  at 43. The unmistakable impli-\\ncation of this argument is that only the passage of time and \\nnew developments justified those decisions. Recognition\\nthat the cases they overruled were egregiously wrong on the \\nday they were handed down was not enough. \\nThe Court has never adopted this strange new version of \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n 70 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nOpinion of the Court \\nstare decisis \\u2014and with good reason.  Does the dissent really\\nmaintain that overruling Plessy  was not justified until the \\ncountry had experienced more than a half-century of state-\\nsanctioned segregation and generations of Black school\\nchildren had suffered all its effects? Post, at 44\\u201345. \\nHere is another example.  On the dissent\\u2019s view, it must \\nhave been wrong for West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette , \\n319 U. S. 624, to overrule Minersville School Dist. v . Gobi-\\ntis, 310 U. S. 586, a bare three years after it was handed down. In both cases, children who were Jehovah\\u2019s Wit-\\nnesses refused on religious grounds to salute the flag or re-\\ncite the pledge of allegiance.  The Barnette Court did not \\nclaim that its reexamination of  the issue was prompted by \\nany intervening legal or factual developments, so if the Court had followed the dissent\\u2019s new version of stare deci -\\nsis, it would have been compelled to adhere to Gobitis and \\ncountenance continued First Amendment violations for \\nsome unspecified period.\\nPrecedents should be respected, but sometimes the Court\\nerrs, and occasionally the Court issues an important deci-sion that is egregiously wrong.  When that happens, stare \\ndecisis is not a straitjacket.  And indeed, the dissent even-tually admits that a decision could \\u201cbe overruled just be-\\ncause it is terribly wrong,\\u201d though the dissent does not ex -\\nplain when that would be so.  Post , at 45. \\n2 \\nEven if the dissent were correct in arguing that an egre-\\ngiously wrong decision should (almost) never be overruled \\nunless its mistake is later highlighted by \\u201cmajor legal or \\nfactual changes,\\u201d reexamination of Roe and Casey  would be \\namply justified. We have already mentioned a number of \\npost-Casey  developments, see supra, at 33\\u201334, 59\\u201363, but \\nthe most profound change may be the failure of the Casey \\nplurality\\u2019s call for \\u201cthe contendi ng sides\\u201d in the controversy\\nabout abortion \\u201cto end their national division,\\u201d 505 U.

That has not happened, and there is no reason to think \\nthat another decision sticking with Roe would achieve what \\nCasey  could not. \\nThe dissent, however, is undeterred.  It contends that the \\n\\u201cvery controversy surrounding Roe and Casey \\u201d is an im -\\nportant stare decisis consideration that requires upholding \\nthose precedents. See post, at 55\\u201357.  The dissent charac-\\nterizes Casey as a \\u201cprecedent about precedent\\u201d that is per-\\nmanently shielded from further evaluation under tradi -\\ntional stare decisis principles. See post,  at 57.  But as we \\nhave explained, Casey broke new ground when it treated \\nthe national controversy provoked by Roe as a ground for \\nrefusing to reconsider that decision, and no subsequent case\\nhas relied on that factor.  Our decision today simply applies longstanding stare decisis factors instead of applying a ver-\\nsion of the doctrine that seems to apply only in abortion cases. \\n3 \\nFinally, the dissent suggests that our decision calls into \\nquestion Griswold, Eisenstadt , Lawrence, and Obergefell. \\nPost, at 4\\u20135, 26\\u201327, n. 8.  But we have stated unequivocally \\nthat \\u201c[n]othing in this opinion should be understood to castdoubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\\u201d Supra, \\nat 66. We have also explained why that is so: rights regard -\\ning contraception and same-sex relationships are inher-ently different from the right to abortion because the latter\\n(as we have stressed) uniquely involves what Roe and Casey\\ntermed \\u201cpotential life.\\u201d  Roe, 410 U. S., at 150 (emphasis de-\\nleted); Casey , 505 U. S., at 852.  Therefore, a right to abor-\\ntion cannot be justified by a purported analogy to the rights \\nrecognized in those other cases or by \\u201cappeals to a broader \\nright to autonomy.\\u201d Supra, at 32. It is hard to see how we \\ncould be clearer. Moreover, even putting aside that these \\ncases are distinguishable, there is a further point that the \\ndissent ignores: Each precedent is subject to its own stare \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  72 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nOpinion of the Court \\ndecisis analysis, and the factors that our doctrine instructs\\nus to consider like reliance and workability are different for \\nthese cases than for our abortion jurisprudence. \\nB \\n1 \\nWe now turn to the concurrence in the judgment, which\\nreproves us for deciding whether Roe and Casey  should be \\nretained or overruled. That opinion (which for conveniencewe will call simply \\u201cthe concurrence\\u201d) recommends a \\u201cmore \\nmeasured course,\\u201d which it defe nds based on what it claims \\nis \\u201ca straightforward stare decisis  analysis.\\u201d Post, at 1 \\n(opinion of R\\nOBERTS , C.

Therefore, a new rule that \\ndiscards the viability rule cannot be defended on stare deci-sis grounds.\\nThe concurrence concedes that  its approach would \\u201cnot be \\navailable\\u201d if \\u201cthe rationale of Roe and Casey  were inextrica-\\nbly entangled with and dependent upon the viability stand-ard.\\u201d Post, at 7.

Post, at 7\\u20138. That is simply\\nincorrect. \\nRoe\\u2019s trimester rule was expressly tied to viability, see \\n410 U. S., at 163\\u2013164, and viability played a critical role in later abortion decisions. For example, in Planned \\nParenthood of Central Mo . v. Danforth , 428 U.

If viability was not an essential part of the rule \\nadopted in Roe, the Court would have had no need to make \\nthat comparison. \\nThe holding in Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, is even \\nmore instructive. In that ca se, the Court noted that prior\\ncases had \\u201cstressed viability\\u201d and reiterated that \\u201c[v]iabil-ity is the critical point\\u201d under Roe. 439 U.

It de-\\nscribed the rule as Roe\\u2019s \\u201ccentral holding,\\u201d 505 U.

In Casey , the Court held that Pennsylva-\\nnia\\u2019s spousal-notification provision was facially unconstitu-tional, not just that it was unconstitutional as applied to\\nabortions sought prior to the time when a woman has had \\na reasonable opportunity to choose.  See 505 U. S., at 887\\u2013 898. The same is true of Whole Women\\u2019s Health , which held \\nthat certain rules that required physicians performingabortions to have admitting priv ileges at a nearby hospital \\nwere facially unconstitutional because they placed \\u201ca sub -\\nstantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previabil-\\nity abortion .\\u201d 579 U.

If that rule is to become the law of the land, it must stand on its own, but the concurrence makes no attempt to\\nshow that this rule represents a correct interpretation of \\nthe Constitution. The concurrence does not claim that the \\nright to a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion is \\n\\u201c\\u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\\u2019s history and tradition\\u2019 \\u201d and \\n\\u201c\\u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\\u2019 \\u201d  Glucksberg , \\n521 U.

And if the Constitution protects a woman\\u2019s right to\\nobtain an abortion, the opinion does not explain why that right should end after the point at which all \\u201creasonable\\u201d \\nwomen will have decided whether to seek an abortion. \\nWhile the concurrence is moved by a desire for judicial min-\\nimalism, \\u201cwe cannot embrace a narrow ground of decisionsimply because it is narrow; it must also be right.\\u201d Citizens \\nUnited , 558 U.

Some States have \\nset deadlines for obtaining an abortion that are shorter \\nthan Mississippi\\u2019s.  See, e.g., Memphis Center for Reproduc -\\ntive Health v.

If we held only that Mississippi\\u2019s 15-week ruleis constitutional, we would soon be called upon to pass on \\nthe constitutionality of a panopl y of laws with shorter dead-\\nlines or no deadline at all.  The \\u201cmeasured course\\u201d charted by the concurrence would be fraught with turmoil until the\\nCourt answered the question that the concurrence seeks to defer. \\nEven if the Court ultimately adopted the new rule sug -\\ngested by the concurrence, we would be faced with the dif-\\nficult problem of spelling out what it means. For example,\\nif the period required to gi ve women a \\u201creasonable\\u201d oppor-\\ntunity to obtain an abortion were pegged, as the concur -\\nrence seems to suggest, at the point when a certain percent-\\nage of women make that choice, see post, at 1\\u20132, 9\\u201310, we \\nwould have to identify the relevant percentage.  It would \\nalso be necessary to explain what the concurrence means when it refers to \\u201crare circumstances\\u201d that might justify an\\nexception. Post, at 10. And if this new right aims to give \\nwomen a reasonable opportuni ty to get an abortion, it \\nwould be necessary to decide  whether factors other than \\npromptness in deciding might have a bearing on whether \\nsuch an opportunity was available.\\nIn sum, the concurrence\\u2019s quest for a middle way would \\nonly put off the day when we wo uld be forced to confront the\\nquestion we now decide.

As we have explained, \\nprocuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional right because such a right has no  basis in the Constitution\\u2019s\\ntext or in our Nation\\u2019s history.  See supra,  at 8\\u201339. \\nIt follows that the States may regulate abortion for legit-\\nimate reasons, and when such regulations are challenged under the Constitution, courts cannot \\u201csubstitute their so-\\ncial and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bod-\\nies.\\u201d Ferguson , 372 U.

That re-\\nspect for a legislature\\u2019s judgment applies even when the\\nlaws at issue concern matters of great social significance \\nand moral substance.

After overruling these demonstra -\\nbly erroneous decisions, the question would remainwhether other constitutional provisions guarantee the myr-\\niad rights that our substantive due process cases have gen-\\nerated.

The interests on both \\nsides of the abortion issue are extraordinarily weighty. \\nOn the one side, many pro-choice advocates forcefully ar-\\ngue that the ability to obtain an abortion is critically im-portant for women\\u2019s personal and  professional lives, and for \\nwomen\\u2019s health. They contend that the widespread availa-bility of abortion has been e ssential for women to advance \\nin society and to achieve greater equality over the last 50 \\nyears. And they maintain that women must have the free-\\ndom to choose for themselves whether to have an abortion. \\nOn the other side, many pro-life advocates forcefully ar-\\ngue that a fetus is a human life.  They contend that all hu-\\nman life should be protected as a matter of human dignity \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 2 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nKAVANAUGH , J., concurring \\nand fundamental morality.  And they stress that a signifi-\\ncant percentage of Americans with pro-life views are \\nwomen. \\nWhen it comes to abortion, one interest must prevail over \\nthe other at any given point in a pregnancy. Many Ameri-cans of good faith would prioritize the interests of the preg-\\nnant woman.  Many other Americans of good faith instead\\nwould prioritize the interests in protecting fetal life\\u2014atleast unless, for example, an abortion is necessary to save \\nthe life of the mother.  Of course, many Americans are con-\\nflicted or have nuanced views that may vary depending onthe particular time in pregnancy, or the particular circum -\\nstances of a pregnancy.\\nThe issue before this Court, however, is not the policy or\\nmorality of abortion.  The issue before this Court is what the Constitution says about abortion. The Constitution \\ndoes not take sides on the issue of abortion.  The text of the \\nConstitution does not refer to or encompass abortion.  To be \\nsure, this Court has held that the Constitution protects un-enumerated rights that are deep ly rooted in this Nation\\u2019s \\nhistory and tradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered\\nliberty. But a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in Amer -\\nican history and tradition, as the Court today thoroughlyexplains.\\n1 \\nOn the question of abortion, the Constitution is therefore\\nneither pro-life nor pro-choice. The Constitution is neutral \\nand leaves the issue for the people and their elected repre-\\nsentatives to resolve through the democratic process in the \\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 \\n1The Court\\u2019s opinion today also recounts the pre-constitutional \\ncommon-law history in England.  That English history supplies back-\\nground information on the issue of abortion.  As I see it, the dispositivepoint in analyzing Americ an history and tradition for purposes of the\\nFourteenth Amendment inquiry is that abortion was largely prohibited\\nin most American States as of 1868 when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, and that abortion rema ined largely prohibited in most \\nAmerican States until Roe was decided in 1973. \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 3 Cite as: 597 U.

The nine unelected Members of th is Court do not possess the \\nconstitutional authority to ov erride the democratic process \\nand to decree either a pro-life or a pro-choice abortion policy for all 330 million people in the United States. \\nInstead of adhering to the Constitution\\u2019s neutrality, the\\nCourt in Roe took sides on the issue and unilaterally de-\\ncreed that abortion was legal throughout the United Statesup to the point of viability ( about 24 weeks of pregnancy). \\nThe Court\\u2019s decision today prop erly returns the Court to a \\nposition of neutrality and restores the people\\u2019s authority to address the issue of abortion through the processes of dem-\\nocratic self-government estab lished by the Constitution. \\nSome amicus  briefs argue that the Court today should not\\nonly overrule Roe and return to a position of judicial neu-\\ntrality on abortion, but should go further and hold that the \\nConstitution outlaws  abortion throughout the United\\nStates. No Justice of this Court has ever advanced that po-sition.  I respect those who advo cate for that position, just\\nas I respect those who argue that this Court should hold that the Constitution legalizes pre-viability abortion throughout the United States. But both positions are \\nwrong as a constitutional matter, in my view. The Consti-\\ntution neither outlaws abortion nor legalizes abortion.\\nTo be clear, then, th e Court\\u2019s decision today does not out-\\nlaw abortion throughout the United States.  On the con -\\ntrary, the Court\\u2019s decision properly leaves the question of abortion for the people and their elected representatives inthe democratic process. Through that democratic process,\\nthe people and their representa tives may decide to allow or\\nlimit abortion.  As Justice Scalia  stated, the \\u201cStates may, if\\nthey wish, permit abortion on demand, but the Constitution \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n 4 DOBBS v.

By contrast, other States may maintain laws that\\nmore strictly limit abortion.

Moreover, the Constitution \\nauthorizes the creation of new rights\\u2014state and federal,\\nstatutory and constitutional.

S. 186 (1986), would never have \\nbeen overruled and would still be the law. \\nIn his canonical Burnet opinion in 1932, Justice Brandeis\\nstated that in \\u201ccases involving the Federal Constitution,\\nwhere correction through legisl ative action is practically \\nimpossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier deci -\\nsions.\\u201d Burnet  v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co. , 285 U. S. 393, \\n406\\u2212 407 (1932) (dissenting opinion). That description of \\nthe Court\\u2019s practice remains a ccurate today.  Every current\\nMember of this Court has voted to overrule precedent.  And \\nover the last 100 years beginning with Chief Justice Taft\\u2019s \\nappointment in 1921, every one of the 48 Justices appointed\\nto this Court has voted to ov errule precedent.  Many of\\nthose Justices have voted to overrule a substantial number \\nof very significant and long standing precedents.  See, e.g., \\nObergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. 644 (2015) (overruling Baker \\nv. Nelson ); Brown  v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 \\n(1954) (overruling Plessy v. Ferguson ); West Coast Hotel Co. \\nv. Parrish , 300 U. S. 379 (1937) (overruling Adkins v. Chil-\\ndren\\u2019s Hospital of D. C.  and in effect Lochner v.

See Ramos \\nv. Louisiana, 590 U.

The Court in Roe erroneously as -\\nsigned itself the authority to  decide a critically important\\nmoral and policy issue that the Constitution does not grant\\nthis Court the authority to de cide.  As Justice Byron White \\nsuccinctly explained, Roe was \\u201can improvident and extrav-\\nagant exercise of the power of judicial review\\u201d because\\n\\u201cnothing in the language or history of the Constitution\\u201d sup-\\nports a constitutional right to abortion. Bolton , 410 U.

But as the Court today explains, Roe \\nhas caused significant negative jurisprudential and real-world consequences.  By taking sides on a difficult and con-\\ntentious issue on which the Constitution is neutral, Roe \\noverreached and exceeded this Court\\u2019s constitutional au-thority; gravely distorted the Nation\\u2019s understanding of\\nthis Court\\u2019s proper constituti onal role; and caused signifi-\\ncant harm to what Roe itself recognized as the State\\u2019s \\u201cim-\\nportant and legitimate interest\\u201d in protecting fetal life.  410 U. S., at 162. All of that explains why tens of millions of \\nAmericans\\u2014and the 26 States t hat explicitly ask the Court \\nto overrule Roe \\u2014do not accept Roe even 49 years later. \\nUnder the Court\\u2019s longstanding stare decisis  principles, Roe \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n 8 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nKAVANAUGH , J., concurring \\nshould be overruled.3\\n But the stare decisis analysis here is somewhat more \\ncomplicated because of Casey . In 1992, 19 years after Roe, \\nCasey  acknowledged the continuing dispute over Roe. The \\nCourt sought to find common ground that would resolve the \\nabortion debate and end the national controversy. After \\ncareful and thoughtful consideration, the Casey plurality\\nreaffirmed a right to abortion through viability (about 24weeks), while also allowing so mewhat more regulation of\\nabortion than Roe  had allowed.\\n4 \\nI have deep and unyielding respect for the Justices who\\nwrote the Casey plurality opinion.  And I respect the Casey\\nplurality\\u2019s good-faith effort to locate some middle ground orcompromise that could resolve this controversy for America.\\nBut as has become increasingly evident over time, Casey \\u2019s \\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 \\n3I also agree with the Court\\u2019s conclusi on today with respect to reliance. \\nBroad notions of societal reliance have been invoked in support of Roe, \\nbut the Court has not analyzed relianc e in that way in the past. For \\nexample, American business es and workers relied on Lochner  v. New \\nYork , 198 U. S. 45 (1905), and Adkins v. Children\\u2019s Hospital of D. C., 261 \\nU. S. 525 (1923), to construct a laissez-faire economy that was free of\\nsubstantial regulation.  In West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish , 300 U. S. 379 \\n(1937), the Court nonetheless overruled Adkins and in effect Lochner . \\nAn entire region of the country relied on Plessy  v. Ferguson , 163 U. S. \\n537 (1896), to enforce a system of racial segregation.  In Brown  v. Board \\nof Education , 347 U. S. 483 (1954), the Court overruled Plessy .  Much of \\nAmerican society was built around th e traditional view of marriage that \\nwas upheld in Baker  v. Nelson , 409 U. S. 810 (1972), and that was re -\\nflected in laws ranging from tax laws to estate laws to family laws.  In \\nObergefell  v. Hodges , 576 U. S. 644 (2015), the Court nonetheless over-\\nruled Baker . \\n4As the Court today notes, Casey \\u2019s approach to stare decisis  pointed in\\ntwo directions.  Casey  reaffirmed Roe\\u2019s viability line, but it expressly \\noverruled the Roe trimester framework and al so expressly overruled two \\nlandmark post- Roe abortion cases\\u2014 Akron v. Akron Center for Reproduc -\\ntive Health , Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (1983), and Thornburgh v. American Col-\\nlege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , 476 U. S. 747 (1986).  See Casey , \\n505 U. S., at 870, 872 \\u2212873, 878 \\u2212879, 882.  Casey  itself thus directly con-\\ntradicts any notion of absolute stare decisis  in abortion cases. \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  9 Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) \\nKAVANAUGH , J., concurring \\nwell-intentioned effort did not resolve the abortion debate. \\nThe national division has not ended.  In recent years, a sig-\\nnificant number of States have enacted abortion re-strictions that directly conflict with Roe. Those laws cannot \\nbe dismissed as political stunts or as outlier laws. Those numerous state laws collectively represent the sincere and \\ndeeply held views of tens of millions of Americans who con-\\ntinue to fervently believe that allowing abortions up to 24weeks is far too radical and far too extreme, and does not \\nsufficiently account for what Roe itself recognized as the \\nState\\u2019s \\u201cimportant and legitimate interest\\u201d in protecting fe-tal life. 410 U. S., at 162.  In this case, moreover, a majority \\nof the States\\u201426 in all\\u2014ask the Court to overrule Roe and \\nreturn the abortion issue to the States.  In short, Casey \\u2019s stare decisis  analysis rested in part on a\\npredictive judgment about the future development of state \\nlaws and of the people\\u2019s views on the abortion issue.  But \\nthat predictive judgment has not borne out. As the Court \\ntoday explains, the experience over the last 30 years con-\\nflicts with Casey \\u2019s predictive judgment and therefore under-\\nmines Casey \\u2019s precedential force.\\n5 \\nIn any event, although Casey is relevant to the stare de-\\ncisis analysis, the question of whether to overrule Roe can-\\nnot be dictated by Casey alone.  To illustrate that stare de -\\ncisis point, consider an example.  Suppose that in 1924 this\\nCourt had expressly reaffirmed Plessy v. Ferguson  and up-\\nheld the States\\u2019 authority to segregate people on the basis\\nof race. Would the Court in Brown some 30 years later in \\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 \\n5To be clear, public opposition to a prior decision is not a basis for over-\\nruling (or reaffirming) that decision.  Rather, the question of whether to\\noverrule a precedent must be analyz ed under this Court\\u2019s traditional \\nstare decisis  factors.  The only point here is that Casey  adopted a special \\nstare decisis  principle with respect to Roe based on the idea of resolving\\nthe national controversy and ending th e national division over abortion. \\nThe continued and significant opposition to Roe, as reflected in the laws \\nand positions of numerous States, is relevant to assessing Casey  on its \\nown terms. \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  10 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nKAVANAUGH , J., concurring \\n1954 have reaffirmed Plessy and upheld racially segregated\\nschools simply because of that  intervening 1924 precedent? \\nSurely the answer is no. \\nIn sum, I agree with the Court\\u2019s application today of the\\nprinciples of stare decisis  and its conclusion that Roe should \\nbe overruled. \\nIII \\nAfter today\\u2019s decision, the nine Members of this Court \\nwill no longer decide the basic legality of pre-viability abor-\\ntion for all 330 million Americans .  That issue will be re-\\nsolved by the people and their representatives in the demo-cratic process in the States or Congress.  But the parties\\u2019 \\narguments have raised other related questions, and I ad-dress some of them here. \\nFirst  is the question of how this decision will affect other \\nprecedents involving issues such as contraception and mar-\\nriage\\u2014in particular, the decisions in Griswold v. Connecti-\\ncut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt  v. Baird , 405 U. S. 438 \\n(1972); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); and Oberge-\\nfell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. 644 (2015).  I emphasize what the\\nCourt today states: Overruling Roe does not mean the over-\\nruling of those precedents, and does not  threaten or cast \\ndoubt on those precedents. \\nSecond, as I see it, some of the other abortion-related le -\\ngal questions raised by today\\u2019s decision are not especially \\ndifficult as a constitutional matter. For example, may a\\nState bar a resident of that State from traveling to another\\nState to obtain an abortion? In my view, the answer is no\\nbased on the constitutional right to interstate travel.  Maya State retroactively impose liability or punishment for an\\nabortion that occurred before to day\\u2019s decision takes effect? \\nIn my view, the answer is no based on the Due Process Clause or the Ex Post Facto  Clause.  Cf. Bouie  v. City of \\nColumbia, 378 U. S. 347 (1964).\\nOther abortion-related legal questions may emerge in the \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  11 Cite as: 597 U.

But this Court will no longer decide the fundamen-\\ntal question of whether abortion must be allowed through-\\nout the United States through 6 weeks, or 12 weeks, or 15 \\nweeks, or 24 weeks, or some other line.  The Court will no \\nlonger decide how to evaluate the interests of the pregnant \\nwoman and the interests in protecting fetal life throughout \\npregnancy.  Instead, those difficult moral and policy ques-\\ntions will be decided, as the Constitution dictates, by thepeople and their elected repres entatives through the consti-\\ntutional processes of democratic self-government. \\n* * * \\nThe Roe Court took sides on a consequential moral and \\npolicy issue that this Court had  no constitutional authority \\nto decide. By taking sides, the Roe Court distorted the Na-\\ntion\\u2019s understanding of this Court\\u2019s proper role in the Amer-ican constitutional system and thereby damaged the Court\\nas an institution. As Justice Scalia explained, Roe \\u201cde-\\nstroyed the compromises of th e past, rendered compromise \\nimpossible for the future, and required the entire issue to \\nbe resolved uniformly, at the national level.\\u201d Casey , 505 \\nU. S., at 995 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and \\ndissenting in part).\\nThe Court\\u2019s decision today properly returns the Court to \\na position of judicial neutrality on the issue of abortion, and properly restores the people\\u2019s authority to resolve the issue \\nof abortion through the processes of democratic self-\\ngovernment established by the Constitution. \\nTo be sure, many Americans will disagree with the\\nCourt\\u2019s decision today.  That would be true no matter how \\nthe Court decided this case.  Both sides on the abortion is-\\nsue believe sincerely and passionately in the rightness of\\ntheir cause. Especially in those difficult and fraught cir-\\ncumstances, the Court must scrupulously adhere to the\\nConstitution\\u2019s neutral position on the issue of abortion. \\nSince 1973, more than 20 Justices of this Court have now \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n 12 DOBBS v.

I greatly re -\\nspect all of the Justices, past and present, who have done \\nso. Amidst extraordinary controversy and challenges, all ofthem have addressed the abortion issue in good faith after \\ncareful deliberation, and based on their sincere understand-\\nings of the Constitution and of precedent. I have endeav-\\nored to do the same. \\nIn my judgment, on the issue of abortion, the Constitu-\\ntion is neither pro-life nor pro-choice.  The Constitution is neutral, and this Court likewise must be scrupulously neu-\\ntral. The Court today properly heeds the constitutional principle of judicial neutrality and returns the issue of abor-\\ntion to the people and their elected representatives in the \\ndemocratic process. \\n Cite as:  597 U.

Mississippi\\u2019s law al -\\nlows a woman three months to obtain an abortion, well be -\\nyond the point at which it is considered \\u201clate\\u201d to discover a \\npregnancy. See A. Ayoola, Late Recognition of Unintended \\nPregnancies, 32 Pub. Health Nursing 462 (2015) (preg-\\nnancy is discoverable and ordi narily discovered by six \\nweeks of gestation). I see no sound basis for questioningthe adequacy of that opportunity.\\nBut that is all I would say, out of adherence to a simple\\nyet fundamental principle of judicial restraint: If it is notnecessary to decide more to disp ose of a case, then it is nec-\\nessary not to decide more.  Perhap s we are not always per-\\nfect in following that command, and certainly there arecases that warrant an exception. But this is not one of \\nthem. Surely we should adhere closely to principles of judi-\\ncial restraint here, where the broader path the Courtchooses entails repudiating a constitutional right we have \\nnot only previously recognized, but also expressly reaf-\\nfirmed applying the doctrine of stare decisis . The Court\\u2019s \\nopinion is thoughtful and thorough, but those virtues can-not compensate for the fact that its dramatic and conse-\\nquential ruling is unnecessary to decide the case before us. \\nI \\nLet me begin with my agreement with the Court, on the\\nonly question we need decide here: whether to retain the\\nrule from Roe and Casey that a woman\\u2019s right to terminate \\nher pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is re-\\ngarded as \\u201cviable\\u201d outside the womb.  I agree that this rule should be discarded. \\nFirst, this Court seriously erred in Roe in adopting via-\\nbility as the earliest point at which a State may legislate to \\nadvance its substantial interests in the area of abortion. \\nSee ante,  at 50\\u201353. Roe set forth a rigid three-part frame -\\nwork anchored to viability, wh ich more closely resembled a\\nregulatory code than a body of constitutional law.

Neither the \\nTexas statute challenged in Roe nor the Georgia statute at\\nissue in its companion case, Doe v. Bolton , 410 U. S. 179 \\n(1973), included any gestational age limit.  No party or ami-\\ncus asked the Court to adopt a bright line viability rule. \\nAnd as for Casey , arguments for or against the viability rule \\nplayed only a de minimis  role in the parties\\u2019 briefing and in \\nthe oral argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 17\\u201318, 51 (fleeting discussion of the viability rule).\\nIt is thus hardly surprising that neither Roe  nor Casey\\nmade a persuasive or even colorable argument for why the\\ntime for terminating a pregnancy must extend to viability. \\nThe Court\\u2019s jurisprudence on this issue is a textbook illus-tration of the perils of deciding a question neither presented nor briefed. As has been often noted, Roe \\u2019s defense of the \\nline boiled down to the circular assertion that the State\\u2019s interest is compelling only when an unborn child can live\\noutside the womb, because that is when the unborn child \\ncan live outside the womb. See 410 U. S., at 163\\u2013164; see also J. Ely, The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe \\nv. Wade , 82 Yale L.

See \\n505 U. S., at 870.  But see ante, at 53 (opinion of the Court) \\n(discussing the difficulties in applying the viability stand-ard). Although the plurality attempted to add more content \\nby opining that \\u201cit might be said that a woman who fails to act before viability has consente d to the State\\u2019s intervention \\non behalf of the developing child,\\u201d Casey , 505 U.

United States  v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521 \\n(1995).

Rev. 249, 276\\u2013279(2009).\\nConsider, for example, statutes passed in a number of ju-\\nrisdictions that forbid abortions after twenty weeks of preg-nancy, premised on the theory that a fetus can feel pain at \\nthat stage of development.  See, e.g., Ala. Code \\u00a726\\u201323B\\u20132\\n(2018). Assuming that prevention of fetal pain is a legiti-\\nmate state interest after Gonzales , there seems to be no rea-\\nson why viability would be relev ant to the permissibility of \\nsuch laws.

It is indeed \\u201ctelling that \\nother countries almost uniformly eschew\\u201d a viability line. Ante, at 53 (opinion of the Court).

See ante, at 73\\u201374. I agree that\\u2014whether it was \\noriginally holding or dictum\\u2014the viability line is clearly part of our \\u201cpast precedent,\\u201d and the Court has applied it as \\nsuch in several cases since Roe. Ante, at 73. My point is \\nthat Roe adopted two distinct rules of constitutional law:\\none, that a woman has the right to choose to terminate a \\npregnancy; two, that such right may be overridden by the State\\u2019s legitimate interests when the fetus is viable outside\\nthe womb. The latter is obviously distinct from the former. \\nI would abandon that timing rule, but see no need in this\\ncase to consider the basic right.\\nThe Court contends that it is impossible to address Roe\\u2019s \\nconclusion that the Constitution protects the woman\\u2019s rightto abortion, without also addressing Roe\\u2019s rule that the \\nState\\u2019s interests are not consti tutionally adequate to justify \\na ban on abortion until viability. See ibid. But we have \\npartially overruled precedents before, see, e.g., United \\nStates v. Miller , 471 U. S. 130, 142\\u2013144 (1985); Daniels  v. \\nWilliams , 474 U.

S. 79, 90\\u201393 (1986), and certainly have never \\nheld that a distinct holding defining the contours of a con-stitutional right must be treated as part and parcel of the \\nright itself.\\nOverruling the subsidiary rule is sufficient to resolve this \\ncase in Mississippi\\u2019s favor. The law at issue allows abor-tions up through fifteen weeks, providing an adequate op-portunity to exercise the right Roe protects. By the time a\\npregnant woman has reached that point, her pregnancy iswell into the second trimester.  Pregnancy tests are now in -\\nexpensive and accurate, and a woman ordinarily discovers she is pregnant by six weeks of  gestation.  See A. Branum \\n& K.

Safe and effective abortifa-\\ncients, moreover, are now readily available, particularlyduring those early stages. See I. Adibi et al., Abortion, 22 \\nGeo. J. Gender & L. 279, 303 (2021).  Given all this, it is no \\nsurprise that the vast majority of abortions happen in the\\nfirst trimester.  See Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\\nvention, Abortion Surveillance\\u2014United States 1 (2020).Presumably most of the remainder would also take place\\nearlier if later abortions were not a legal option.  Ample ev-\\nidence thus suggests that a 15-week ban provides sufficient time, absent rare circumstances , for a woman \\u201cto decide for \\nherself \\u201d whether to terminate her pregnancy.

A narrower decision rejecting the misguided viability line would be markedly less unsettling, and noth-\\ning more is needed to decide this case.   \\nOur cases say that the effect of overruling a precedent on \\nreliance interests is a factor to consider in deciding whether\\nto take such a step, and respondents argue that generationsof women have relied on the right to an abortion in organ-\\nizing their relationships and pl anning their futures.  Brief \\nfor Respondents 36\\u201341; see also Casey , 505 U. S., at 856 \\n(making the same point).  The Court questions whether\\nthese concerns are pertinent under our precedents, see ante, at 64\\u201365, but the issue would not even arise with a \\ndecision rejecting only the viability line: It cannot reasona-bly be argued that women have shaped their lives in part \\non the assumption that they would be able to abort up to \\nviability, as opposed to fifteen weeks. \\nIn support of its holding, the Court cites three seminal \\nconstitutional decisions that involved overruling prior prec-\\nedents: Brown  v. Board of Education , 347 U. S. 483 (1954), \\nWest Virginia Bd. of Ed.  v. Barnette , 319 U. S. 624 (1943), \\nand West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish , 300 U.

Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and \\nPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.  v. Casey , 505 U. S. \\n833 (1992), have protected the liberty and equality of \\nwomen. Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed, that the Constitu-\\ntion safeguards a woman\\u2019s right to decide for herself whether to bear a child. Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed, \\nthat in the first stages of pregnancy, the government could not make that choice for wome n.  The government could not \\ncontrol a woman\\u2019s body or the course of a woman\\u2019s life: It \\ncould not determine what the woman\\u2019s future would be. See \\nCasey , 505 U.

Respecting a woman as an autonomous being, and granting her full equality, meant giving her substantial choice over this most\\npersonal and most consequential of all life decisions. \\nRoe and Casey well understood the difficulty and divisive-\\nness of the abortion issue.  The Court knew that Americans \\nhold profoundly different view s about the \\u201cmoral[ity]\\u201d of \\n\\u201cterminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage.\\u201d  Ca -\\nsey, 505 U.

So the Court struck a balance, as it \\noften does when values and goals compete.  It held that the \\nState could prohibit abortions after fetal viability, so long\\nas the ban contained exceptions to safeguard a woman\\u2019s life \\nor health. It held that even before viability, the State could \\nregulate the abortion procedure in multiple and meaningful \\nways.  But until the viability line was crossed, the Court \\nheld, a State could not impose a \\u201csubstantial obstacle\\u201d on a\\nwoman\\u2019s \\u201cright to elect the procedure\\u201d as she (not the gov-\\nernment) thought proper, in light of all the circumstances \\nand complexities of her own life.  Ibid. \\nToday, the Court discards that balance. It says that from \\nthe very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term,\\neven at the steepest personal and familial costs.  An abor -\\ntion restriction, the majority holds, is permissible whenever \\nrational, the lowest level of scrutiny known to the law.  And \\nbecause, as the Court has often stated, protecting fetal life \\nis rational, States will feel free to enact all manner of re-\\nstrictions. The Mississippi la w at issue here bars abortions\\nafter the 15th week of pregnancy. Under the majority\\u2019s rul-\\ning, though, another State\\u2019s law could do so after ten weeks, \\nor five or three or one\\u2014or, again, from the moment of ferti-\\nlization. States have already passed such laws, in anticipa-\\ntion of today\\u2019s ruling.  More will follow. Some States have \\nenacted laws extending to all forms of abortion procedure, \\nincluding taking medication in one\\u2019s own home.  They have\\npassed laws without any except ions for when the woman is \\nthe victim of rape or incest. Under those laws, a woman will have to bear her rapist\\u2019s child or a young girl her fa-\\nther\\u2019s\\u2014no matter if doing so will destroy her life.  So too, after today\\u2019s ruling, some States may compel women to \\ncarry to term a fetus with severe physical anomalies\\u2014for \\nexample, one afflicted with Ta y-Sachs disease, sure to die \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  3 Cite as: 597 U.

States may even argue that a\\nprohibition on abortion need make no provision for protect-\\ning a woman from risk of death or physical harm.

A State can of course \\nimpose criminal penalties on abortion providers, including \\nlengthy prison sentences.  But some States will not stop\\nthere. Perhaps, in the wake of today\\u2019s decision, a state law will criminalize the woman\\u2019s conduct too, incarcerating or\\nfining her for daring to seek or obtain an abortion.

The lone rationale for \\nwhat the majority does today is that the right to elect an\\nabortion is not \\u201cdeeply rooted in history\\u201d: Not until Roe, the \\nmajority argues, did people think abortion fell within the\\nConstitution\\u2019s guarantee of liberty.  Ante , at 32.  The same \\ncould be said, though, of most of the rights the majorityclaims it is not tampering with.  The majority could write \\njust as long an opinion showing, for example, that until the mid-20th century, \\u201cthere was no support in American law\\nfor a constitutional right to  obtain [contraceptives].\\u201d  Ante , \\nat 15. So one of two things must be true. Either the major-ity does not really believe in its own reasoning.  Or if it does, \\nall rights that have no history stretching back to the mid-\\n19th century are insecure.  Either the mass of the majority\\u2019s\\nopinion is hypocrisy, or additio nal constitutional rights are \\nunder threat. It is one or the other. \\nOne piece of evidence on that score seems especially sa-\\nlient: The majority\\u2019s cavalier approach to overturning this \\nCourt\\u2019s precedents. Stare decisis is the Latin phrase for a \\nfoundation stone of the rule of law: that things decided \\nshould stay decided unless there is a very good reason for \\nchange. It is a doctrine of judicial modesty and humility. \\nThose qualities are not evident in today\\u2019s opinion. The ma-\\njority has no good reason for the upheaval in law and society \\nit sets off. Roe and Casey have been the law of the land for \\ndecades, shaping women\\u2019s expectations of their choices\\nwhen an unplanned pregnancy occurs.  Women have relied \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  6 DOBBS v.

The legal frame -\\nwork Roe and Casey  developed to balance the competing in -\\nterests in this sphere has proved workable in courts across the country.  No recent developments, in either law or fact, \\nhave eroded or cast doubt on th ose precedents.  Nothing, in\\nshort, has changed.  Indeed, the Court in Casey already\\nfound all of that to be true.  Casey is a precedent about prec-\\nedent. It reviewed the same arguments made here in sup-port of overruling Roe, and it found that doing so was not\\nwarranted.  The Court reverses course today for one reason \\nand one reason only: because the composition of this Court \\nhas changed. Stare decisis , this Court has often said, \\u201ccon-\\ntributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process\\u201d by ensuring that decisions are \\u201cfounded in the law \\nrather than in the proclivities of individuals.\\u201d  Payne  v. Ten-\\nnessee , 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991); Vasquez  v. Hillery , 474 \\nU. S. 254, 265 (1986).  Today, the proclivities of individuals \\nrule. The Court departs from its obligation to faithfully and \\nimpartially apply the law. We dissent. \\nI \\nWe start with Roe and Casey , and with their deep connec-\\ntions to a broad swath of this Court\\u2019s precedents.  To hear the majority tell the tale, Roe and Casey  are aberrations: \\nThey came from nowhere, went nowhere\\u2014and so are easy \\nto excise from this Nation\\u2019s co nstitutional law.  That is not \\ntrue.

The majority does\\nnot wish to talk about these ma tters for obvious reasons; to \\ndo so would both ground Roe and Casey in this Court\\u2019s prec-\\nedents and reveal the broad implications of today\\u2019s decision.But the facts will not so handily disappear.

It then set some guideposts.  In \\nthe first trimester of pregnancy, the State could not inter-\\nfere at all with the decision to terminate a pregnancy.  At any time after that point, the State could regulate to protect\\nthe pregnant woman\\u2019s health, such as by insisting that \\nabortion providers and facilities meet safety requirements. \\nAnd after the fetus\\u2019s viability\\u2014the point when the fetus\\n\\u201chas the capability of meaningful life outside the mother\\u2019s womb\\u201d\\u2014the State could ban abortions, except when neces-\\nsary to preserve the woman\\u2019s life or health.

Id., at 851 (emphasis deleted). So too, Casey rea-\\nsoned, the liberty clause protects the decision of a woman \\nconfronting an unplanned pregnancy.  Her decision about abortion was central, in the same way, to her capacity to \\nchart her life\\u2019s course. See id., at 853. \\nIn reaffirming the right Roe recognized, the Court took \\nfull account of the diversity of views on abortion, and the\\nimportance of various competing state interests. Some \\nAmericans, the Court stated, \\u201cdeem [abortion] nothing\\nshort of an act of violence against innocent human life.\\u201d  505 U. S., at 852.  And each State has an interest in \\u201cthe protec -\\ntion of potential life\\u201d\\u2014as Roe itself had recognized. 505 \\nU. S., at 871 (plurality opinion).  On the one hand, that in-\\nterest was not conclusive.  Th e State could not \\u201cresolve\\u201d the \\n\\u201cmoral and spiritual\\u201d questions raised by abortion in \\u201csucha definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the mat-\\nter.\\u201d Id., at 850 (majority opinion).

Nothing could get those \\ndecisions more wrong.  As just described, Roe and Casey  in-\\nvoked powerful state interests in that protection, operative \\nat every stage of the pregnancy and overriding the woman\\u2019s\\nliberty after viability.

Today\\u2019s Court, that is, does not think \\nthere is anything of constitutional significance attached to\\na woman\\u2019s control of her body and the path of her life. Roe \\nand Casey thought that one-sided view misguided.  In some \\nsense, that is the difference in a nutshell between our prec-edents and the majority opinion. The constitutional regime\\nwe have lived in for the last 50 years recognized competing \\ninterests, and sought a balance between them.  The consti-\\ntutional regime we enter toda y erases the woman\\u2019s interest \\nand recognizes only the State\\u2019s (or the Federal Govern-\\nment\\u2019s). \\nB \\nThe majority makes this change based on a single ques-\\ntion: Did the reproductive right recognized in Roe and Casey \\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 \\nof any significance.\\u201d Ante, at 38.  To the contrary.  The liberty interests \\nunderlying those rights are, as we will describe, quite similar. See infra , \\nat 22\\u201324.  But only in the sphere of  abortion is the state interest in pro-\\ntecting potential life involved. So  only in that sphere, as both Roe and \\nCasey recognized, may a State impinge so far on the liberty interest (bar-\\nring abortion after viability and discouraging it before).  The majority\\u2019s failure to understand this fairly obvi ous point stems from its rejection of\\nthe idea of balancing interests in th is (or maybe in any) constitutional \\ncontext.  Cf. New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen , 597 U. S. \\n___, ___, ___\\u2013___ (2022) (slip op., at 8, 15\\u201317).

The majority says (and with this \\nmuch we agree) that the answer to this question is no: In\\n1868, there was no nationwide right to end a pregnancy,\\nand no thought that the Fourteenth Amendment provided \\none. \\nOf course, the majority opinion refers as well to some \\nlater and earlier history.  On the one side of 1868, it goes back as far as the 13th (the 13th!) century.  See ante, at 17. \\nBut that turns out to be wheel-spinning.

To be sure, most women in 1868 also \\nhad a foreshortened view of their rights: If most men could\\nnot then imagine giving wome n control over their bodies,\\nmost women could not imagine having that kind of auton-\\nomy. But that takes away nothing from the core point. \\nThose responsible for the original Constitution, includingthe Fourteenth Amendment, did not perceive women as\\nequals, and did not recognize women\\u2019s rights.  When the \\nmajority says that we must read our foundational charter \\nas viewed at the time of ratification (except that we may\\nalso check it against the Dark Ages), it consigns women to second-class citizenship. \\nCasey itself understood this point, as will become clear. \\nSee infra , at 23\\u201324. It recollected with dismay a decision\\nthis Court issued just five years after the FourteenthAmendment\\u2019s ratification, approving a State\\u2019s decision to\\ndeny a law license to a woman and suggesting as well that \\na woman had no legal status apart from her husband.  See 505 U.

How is it that \\nuntil today, that same constitutional clause protected a woman\\u2019s right, in the event contraception failed, to end a \\npregnancy in its earlier stages? \\nThe answer is that this Cou rt has rejected the majority\\u2019s\\npinched view of how to read our Constitution.  \\u201cThe Found-\\ners,\\u201d we recently wrote, \\u201cknew they were writing a docu-\\nment designed to apply to ever-changing circumstances\\nover centuries.\\u201d NLRB v.

Instead, \\nthe Framers defined rights in general terms, to permit fu-\\nture evolution in their scope and meaning.

For now, our point is different: It is that \\napplications of liberty and equality can evolve while re-maining grounded in constitu tional principles, constitu-\\ntional history, and constituti onal precedents.  The second \\nJustice Harlan discussed how to strike the right balance \\nwhen he explained why he would have invalidated a State\\u2019sban on contraceptive use.

Yet \\nthey also must recognize that the constitutional \\u201ctradition\\u201d \\nof this country is not captured whole at a single moment. \\nIbid. Rather, its meaning gains content from the long\\nsweep of our history and from successive judicial prece-\\ndents\\u2014each looking to the last and each seeking to apply\\nthe Constitution\\u2019s most fundamental commitments to new \\nconditions.  That is why Americans, to go back to Oberge -\\nfell\\u2019s example, have a right to marry across racial lines.

Because the Court has \\n\\u201cvindicated [the] principle\\u201d over and over that (no matter \\nthe sentiment in 1868) \\u201cthere is a realm of personal libertywhich the government may not enter\\u201d\\u2014especially relating\\nto \\u201cbodily integrity\\u201d and \\u201cfamily life.\\u201d  Id. , at 847, 849, 851. \\nCasey  described in detail the Court\\u2019s contraception cases. \\nSee id., at 848\\u2013849, 851\\u2013853. It noted decisions protecting\\nthe right to marry, including to someone of another race. See id., at 847\\u2013848 (\\u201c[I]nterracial marriage was illegal in \\nmost States in the 19th century, but the Court was no doubt correct in finding it to be an aspect of liberty protected\\nagainst state interference\\u201d).  In reviewing decades and dec -\\nades of constitutional law, Casey  could draw but one conclu-\\nsion: Whatever was true in 1868, \\u201c[i]t is settled now, as itwas when the Court heard arguments in Roe v. Wade , that \\nthe Constitution places limits on a State\\u2019s right to interfere with a person\\u2019s most basic decisions about family and parenthood.\\u201d Id., at 849. \\nAnd that conclusion still held good, until the Court\\u2019s in-\\ntervention here.  It was settled at the time of Roe, settled at \\nthe time of Casey , and settled yesterday that the Constitu-\\ntion places limits on a State\\u2019s power to assert control over\\nan individual\\u2019s body and most personal decisionmaking.  A \\nmultitude of decisions supporting that principle led to Roe\\u2019s \\nrecognition and Casey \\u2019s reaffirmation of the right to choose; \\nand Roe and Casey in turn supported additional protections\\nfor intimate and familial relations.

So apparently, \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment might prov ide protection for things wholly\\nunknown in the 19th century; maybe one day there could be constitu-\\ntional protection for, oh, time travel .

It (liter -\\nally) rattles them off in a single paragraph; and it implies\\nthat they have nothing to do with each other, or with the right to terminate an early pregnancy.  See ante, at 31\\u201332 \\n(asserting that recognizing a relationship among them, as addressing aspects of personal autonomy, would inelucta-\\nbly \\u201clicense fundamental rights\\u201d to illegal \\u201cdrug use [and]\\nprostitution\\u201d). But that is flat wrong. The Court\\u2019s prece-dents about bodily autonomy, sexual and familial relations,\\nand procreation are all interwoven\\u2014all part of the fabric of\\nour constitutional law, and because that is so, of our lives. \\nEspecially women\\u2019s lives, where they safeguard a right to\\nself-determination. \\nAnd eliminating that right, we need to say before further\\ndescribing our precedents, is not taking a \\u201cneutral\\u201d posi-tion, as J\\nUSTICE KAVANAUGH  tries to argue. Ante , at 2\\u20133, \\n5, 7, 11\\u201312 (concurring opinion).  His idea is that neutrality lies in giving the abortion issue to the States, where some can go one way and some anoth er.  But would he say that \\nthe Court is being \\u201cscrupulously neutral\\u201d if it allowed NewYork and California to ban all the guns they want?  Ante , at \\n3. If the Court allowed some States to use unanimous juries\\nand others not? If the Court told the States: Decide for yourselves whether to put res trictions on church attend -\\nance? We could go on\\u2014and in fact we will. SupposeJ\\nUSTICE KAVANAUGH were to say (in line with the majority\\nopinion) that the rights we just listed are more textually or historically grounded than the right to choose. What, then, of the right to contraception or same-sex marriage?  Would \\nit be \\u201cscrupulously neutral\\u201d for the Court to eliminate those \\nrights too? The point of all these examples is that when it \\ncomes to rights, the Court does not act \\u201cneutrally\\u201d when it \\nleaves everything up to the St ates.  Rather, the Court acts \\nneutrally when it protects the right against all comers.

J USTICE KAVANAUGH  cannot obscure that point by ap-\\npropriating the rhetoric of ev en-handedness.  His position\\njust is what it is: A brook-no-compromise refusal to recog -\\nnize a woman\\u2019s right to choose, from the first day of a preg -\\nnancy. And that position, as we will now show, cannot be squared with this Court\\u2019s longstanding view that women \\nindeed have rights (whatever the state of the world in 1868) \\nto make the most personal and consequential decisions about their bodies and their lives. \\nConsider first, then, the line of this Court\\u2019s cases protect-\\ning \\u201cbodily integrity.\\u201d Casey , 505 U. S., at 849.  \\u201cNo right,\\u201d \\nin this Court\\u2019s time-honored view, \\u201cis held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded,\\u201d than \\u201cthe right of every individ-\\nual to the possession and control of his own person.\\u201d Union \\nPacific R. Co. v. Botsford , 141 U. S. 250, 251 (1891); see \\nCruzan  v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health , 497 U. S. 261, 269 \\n(1990) (Every adult \\u201chas a right to determine what shall be \\ndone with his own body\\u201d). Or to put it more simply: Every-\\none, including women, owns their own bodies.  So the Court \\nhas restricted the power of go vernment to interfere with a \\nperson\\u2019s medical decisions or compel her to undergo medical procedures or treatments. See, e.g., Winston v. Lee , 470 \\nU. S. 753, 766\\u2013767 (1985) (forced surgery); Rochin v. Cali-\\nfornia , 342 U. S. 165, 166, 173\\u2013174 (1952) (forced stomach\\npumping); Washington  v. Harper , 494 U.

And that doctrinal \\naffinity is born of a factual likeness.  There are few greater\\nincursions on a body than forcing a woman to complete a \\npregnancy and give birth. For every woman, those experi-\\nences involve all manner of physical changes, medical treat-\\nments (including the possibility of a cesarean section), and \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n 22 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nBREYER , SOTOMAYOR , and K AGAN , JJ., dissenting \\nmedical risk.  Just as one example, an American woman is\\n14 times more likely to die by carrying a pregnancy to term \\nthan by having an abortion. See Whole Woman\\u2019s Health  v. \\nHellerstedt , 579 U. S. 582, 618 (2016).  That women happily\\nundergo those burdens and hazards of their own accord does not lessen how far a State impinges on a woman\\u2019s body\\nwhen it compels her to bring a pregnancy to term.  And for \\nsome women, as Roe recognized, abortions are medically\\nnecessary to prevent harm. See 410 U. S., at 153.  The ma-jority does not say\\u2014which is itself ominous\\u2014whether a State may prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion \\nwhen she and her doctor have determined it is a needed \\nmedical treatment. \\n So too, Roe and Casey fit neatly into a long line of deci-\\nsions protecting from government intrusion a wealth of pri-\\nvate choices about family matters, child rearing, intimate\\nrelationships, and procreation. See Casey , 505 U. S., at 851, \\n857; Roe, 410 U. S., at 152\\u2013153; see also ante, at 31\\u201332 (list-\\ning the myriad decisions of this kind that Casey relied on).\\nThose cases safeguard particular choices about whom to marry; whom to have sex with; what family members to live\\nwith; how to raise children\\u2014and crucially, whether and when to have children.  In varied cases, the Court explained\\nthat those choices\\u2014\\u201cthe most intimate and personal\\u201d a per-\\nson can make\\u2014reflect fundamental aspects of personal \\nidentity; they define the very \\u201cattributes of personhood.\\u201d \\nCasey , 505 U. S., at 851.  And they inevitably shape the na-\\nture and future course of a person\\u2019s life (and often the lives of those closest to her). So, the Court held, those choices belong to the individual, and not the government.  That is \\nthe essence of what liberty requires.\\nAnd liberty may require it, this Court has repeatedly\\nsaid, even when those living in 1868 would not have recog-nized the claim\\u2014because they would not have seen the per -\\nson making it as a full-fledged member of the community.Throughout our history, the sphere of protected liberty has \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n    23 Cite as: 597 U.

In \\nthat way, the constitutional values of liberty and equality \\ngo hand in hand; they do not inhabit the hermetically sealed containers the majority portrays. Compare Obergefell , 576 \\nU. S., at 672\\u2013675, with ante, at 10\\u201311. So before Roe and \\nCasey , the Court expanded in successive cases those who \\ncould claim the right to marry\\u2014though their relationships would have been outside the law\\u2019s protection in the mid -\\n19th century. See, e.g., Loving , 388 U. S. 1 (interracial cou-\\nples); Turner  v. Safley , 482 U. S. 78 (1987) (prisoners); see \\nalso, e.g., Stanley  v. Illinois , 405 U. S. 645, 651\\u2013652 (1972) \\n(offering constitutional protection to untraditional \\u201cfamilyunit[s]\\u201d). And after Roe and Casey , of course, the Court con-\\ntinued in that vein. With a critical stop to hold that theFourteenth Amendment protected same-sex intimacy, the \\nCourt resolved that the Amendment also conferred on \\nsame-sex couples the right to marry.  See Lawrence, 539 \\nU.S. 558; Obergefell, 576 U. S. 644.  In considering that \\nquestion, the Court held, \\u201c[h]istory and tradition,\\u201d espe-cially as reflected in the course of our precedent, \\u201cguide and\\ndiscipline [the] inquiry.\\u201d Id., at 664.  But the sentiments of \\n1868 alone do not and cannot \\u201crule the present.\\u201d  Ibid. \\nCasey similarly recognized the need to extend the consti-\\ntutional sphere of liberty to a previously excluded group.The Court then understood, as the majority today does not, \\nthat the men who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and wrote the state laws of the time did not view women as full \\nand equal citizens. See supra, at 15.  A woman then, Casey\\nwrote, \\u201chad no legal existence separate from her husband.\\u201d 505 U. S., at 897.

But that could not be \\ntrue any longer: The State could not now insist on the his-\\ntorically dominant \\u201cvision of the woman\\u2019s role.\\u201d Id., at 852. \\nAnd equal citizenship, Casey realized, was inescapably con -\\n  \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n 24 DOBBS v.

Today\\u2019s decision, the majority first says, \\u201cdoes \\nnot undermine\\u201d the decisions cited by Roe and Casey\\u2014 the \\nones involving \\u201cmarriage, procreation, contraception, [and]family relationships\\u201d\\u2014\\u201cin any way.\\u201d  Ante , at 32; Casey , 505 \\nU.

See supra, at 23.\\n6  On its later tries, though, the \\nmajority includes those too: \\u201cNothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on  precedents that do not con -\\ncern abortion.\\u201d Ante , at 66; see ante , at 71\\u201372. That right\\nis unique, the majority asserts, \\u201cbecause [abortion] termi -\\nnates life or potential life.\\u201d Ante , at 66 (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted); see ante, at 32, 71\\u201372.

We think not. \\nThe first problem with the majority\\u2019s account comes from \\nJ\\nUSTICE THOMAS \\u2019s concurrence\\u2014which makes clear he is \\nnot with the program. In saying that nothing in today\\u2019s opinion casts doubt on non-abortion precedents, J\\nUSTICE \\nTHOMAS  explains, he means only that they are not at issue \\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 \\n6And note, too, that the author of th e majority opinion recently joined\\na statement, written by another memb er of the majority, lamenting that \\nObergefell deprived States of the ability \\u201cto resolve th[e] question [of\\nsame-sex marriage] through legislation.\\u201d  Davis  v.

So at least one Justice is planning to use \\nthe ticket of today\\u2019s decision again and again and again. \\nEven placing the concurrence to the side, the assurance \\nin today\\u2019s opinion still does not work.  Or at least that is so \\nif the majority is serious about its sole reason for overturn -\\ning Roe and Casey : the legal status of abortion in the 19th \\ncentury.  Except in the places quoted above, the state inter-est in protecting fetal life pl ays no part in the majority\\u2019s\\nanalysis. To the contrary, the majority takes pride in not \\nexpressing a view \\u201cabout the status of the fetus.\\u201d  Ante , at \\n65; see ante, at 32 (aligning itself with Roe\\u2019s and Casey \\u2019s \\nstance of not deciding whether life or potential life is in-\\nvolved); ante, at 38\\u201339 (similar). The majority\\u2019s departure \\nfrom Roe and Casey  rests instead\\u2014and only\\u2014on whether a\\nwoman\\u2019s decision to end a pregnancy involves any Four-\\nteenth Amendment liberty interest (against which Roe and \\nCasey balanced the state interest in preserving fetal life).\\n7 \\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 \\n7Indulge a few more words about this point.  The majority had a choice \\nof two different ways to overrule Roe and Casey.  It could claim that those \\ncases underrated the State\\u2019s interest in fetal life.  Or it could claim that \\nthey overrated a woman\\u2019s constitution al liberty interest in choosing an \\nabortion.  (Or both.)  The majority here rejects the first path, and we can \\nsee why.  Taking that route would have prevented the majority from\\nclaiming that it means only to le ave this issue to the democratic pro-\\ncess\\u2014that it does not have a dog in the fight.  See ante , at 38\\u201339, 65. \\nAnd indeed, doing so might have suggested a revolutionary proposition: that the fetus is itself a constitution ally protected \\u201cperson,\\u201d such that an \\nabortion ban is constitutionally mandated. The majority therefore \\nchooses the second path, arguing th at the Fourteenth Amendment does \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n 27 Cite as: 597 U.

But here is the rub. The law also did not then (and  would not for ages) protect a\\nwealth of other things.  It did not protect the rights recog -\\nnized in Lawrence and Obergefell to same-sex intimacy and \\nmarriage. It did not protect the right recognized in Loving to marry across racial lines.  It did not protect the right rec-ognized in Griswold to contraceptive use.  For that matter, \\nit did not protect the right recognized in Skinner  v. Okla -\\nhoma ex rel. Williamson , 316 U. S. 535 (1942), not to be ster-\\nilized without consent. So if the majority is right in its legalanalysis, all those decisions were wrong, and all those mat-\\nters properly belong to the States too\\u2014whatever the partic-\\nular state interests involved. And if that is true, it is im -\\npossible to understand (as a matter of logic and principle) \\nhow the majority can say that its opinion today does not threaten\\u2014does not even \\u201cundermine\\u201d\\u2014any number of \\nother constitutional rights. Ante , at 32.\\n8 \\nNor does it even help just to take the majority at its word.\\nAssume the majority is sincere in saying, for whatever rea-\\nson, that it will go so far and no further.

And law often has a way of evolving \\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 \\nnot conceive of the abortion decision as implicating liberty, because the\\nlaw in the 19th century gave that choi ce no protection.  The trouble is \\nthat the chosen path\\u2014which is, again, the solitary rationale for the \\nCourt\\u2019s decision\\u2014provides no way to distinguish between the right to \\nchoose an abortion and a range of other rights, including contraception.\\n8The majority briefly (very briefly) gestures at the idea that some stare \\ndecisis  factors might play out differently with respect to these other con-\\nstitutional rights.  But the majority gives no hint as to why.  And the majority\\u2019s (mis)treatment of stare decisis  in this case provides little rea -\\nson to think that the doctrine would stand as a barrier to the majority \\u2019s \\nredoing any other decision it cons idered egregiously wrong.

We fervently ho pe that does not happen be -\\ncause of today\\u2019s decision.  We hope that we will not join Jus -\\ntice Scalia in the book of prophets. But we cannot under-\\nstand how anyone can be confident that today\\u2019s opinion will\\nbe the last of its kind. \\nConsider, as our last word on this issue, contraception.\\nThe Constitution, of course, does not mention that word. And there is no historical right to contraception, of the kind\\nthe majority insists on. To the contrary, the American legal\\nlandscape in the decades after the Civil War was litteredwith bans on the sale of contraceptive devices.  So again,\\nthere seem to be two choices. See supra , at 5, 26\\u201327. If the \\nmajority is serious about its historical approach, then Gris-\\nwold and its progeny are in the line of fire too.  Or if it is \\nnot serious, then . . . what is the basis of today\\u2019s decision? \\nIf we had to guess, we suspect the prospects of this Court\\napproving bans on contraception are low.  But once again,\\nthe future significance of today\\u2019s opinion will be decided in\\nthe future.

As a matter of constitutional method, the \\nmajority\\u2019s commitment to replicate in 2022 every view \\nabout the meaning of liberty held in 1868 has precious little\\nto recommend it.  Our law in th is constitutional sphere, as \\nin most, has for decades upon decades proceeded differ-ently. It has considered fundamental constitutional princi-ples, the whole course of the Nation\\u2019s history and traditions, \\nand the step-by-step evolution of the Court\\u2019s precedents.

Be -\\ncause those laws prevented women from charting the\\ncourse of their own lives, the majority says States can do \\nthe same again. Because in 1868, the government could tell \\na pregnant woman\\u2014even in the first days of her preg-\\nnancy\\u2014that she could do nothing but bear a child, it can \\nonce more impose that command .

And in the rest, the Court relied on one or more of the traditional stare \\ndecisis factors in reaching its conclusion.  The Court found, \\nfor example, (1) a change in legal doctrine that undermined \\nor made obsolete the earlier decision; (2) a factual change\\nthat had the same effect; or (3) an absence of reliance be-cause the earlier decision was less than a decade old.

Dickerson  v. United \\nStates, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000).  Casey itself applied those \\nprinciples, in one of this Court\\u2019s most important precedents \\nabout precedent.  After assessing the traditional stare deci -\\nsis factors, Casey reached the only conclusion possible\\u2014\\nthat stare decisis  operates powerfully here. It still does. \\nThe standards Roe and Casey set out are perfectly worka-\\nble. No changes in either law or fact have eroded the two\\ndecisions.

And it has \\ngiven rise to no more conflict in application than many standards this Court and others unhesitatingly apply every\\nday.\\nGeneral standards, like the undue burden standard, are \\nubiquitous in the law, and parti cularly in constitutional ad-\\njudication. When called on to  give effect to the Constitu -\\ntion\\u2019s broad principles, this Court often crafts flexible standards that can be applied case-by-case to a myriad of\\nunforeseeable circumstances.  See Dickerson, 530 U. S., at \\n441 (\\u201cNo court laying down a ge neral rule can possibly fore-\\nsee the various circumstances\\u201d in which it must apply). So,\\nfor example, the Court asks about undue or substantial bur-\\ndens on speech, on voting, and on interstate commerce.  See, \\ne.g., Arizona Free Enterprise Club\\u2019s Freedom Club PAC  v. \\nBennett, 564 U. S. 721, 748 (2011); Burdick  v. Takushi , 504 \\nU. S. 428, 433\\u2013434 (1992); Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc. , 397 \\nU. S. 137, 142 (1970). The Casey undue burden standard is \\nthe same. It also resembles general standards that courts \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n 34 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nBREYER , SOTOMAYOR , and K AGAN , JJ., dissenting \\nwork with daily in other legal spheres\\u2014like the \\u201crule of rea-\\nson\\u201d in antitrust law or the \\u201carbitrary and capricious\\u201d \\nstandard for agency decisionmaking.

Applying gen-\\neral standards to particular cases is, in many contexts, justwhat it means to do law. \\nAnd the undue burden standard has given rise to no un-\\nusual difficulties. Of course, it has provoked some disagree-ment among judges.  Casey knew it would: That much \\u201cis to \\nbe expected in the application of any legal standard whichmust accommodate life\\u2019s complexity.\\u201d 505 U. S., at 878 \\n(plurality opinion). Which is to say: That much is to be ex-\\npected in the application of any legal standard.  But the ma -\\njority vastly overstates the di visions among judges applying \\nthe standard. We count essentially two.  T\\nHE CHIEF \\nJUSTICE  disagreed with other Justices in the June Medical \\nmajority about whether Casey called for weighing the ben-\\nefits of an abortion regulation against its burdens.

The majority says \\nthere is a split about bans on certai n types of abortion procedures.  See \\nante, at 61, and n. 55. But the one court to have separated itself on that\\nissue did so based on a set of factual findings significantly different from \\nthose in other cases. Compare Whole Woman\\u2019s Health v.

About 18 per-\\ncent of pregnancies in this country end in abortion, and \\nabout one quarter of American women will have an abortion \\nbefore the age of 45.\\n22  Those numbers reflect the predicta-\\nble and life-changing effects of carrying a pregnancy, giving \\nbirth, and becoming a parent. As Casey understood, people\\ntoday rely on their ability to control and time pregnancieswhen making countless life decisions: where to live,\\nwhether and how to invest in education or careers, how to \\nallocate financial resources, and how to approach intimate and family relationships.

The majority\\u2019s refusal \\neven to consider the life-altering consequences of reversing \\nRoe and Casey  is a stunning indictment of its decision. \\nD \\nOne last consideration counsels against the majority\\u2019s\\nruling: the very controversy surrounding Roe and Casey . \\nThe majority accuses Casey of acting outside the bounds of\\nthe law to quell the conflict over abortion\\u2014of imposing an \\nunprincipled \\u201csettlement\\u201d of the issue in an effort to end\\n\\u201cnational division.\\u201d Ante , at 67. But that is not what Casey \\ndid. As shown above, Casey applied traditional principles \\nof stare decisis\\u2014which the majority today ignores\\u2014in reaf-\\nfirming Roe. Casey carefully assessed changed circum-\\nstances (none) and reliance interests (profound).  It consid-ered every aspect of how Roe\\u2019s framework operated. It \\nadhered to the law in its analysis, and it reached the con-clusion that the law required. True enough that Casey  took \\nnotice of the \\u201cnational controversy\\u201d about abortion: The Court knew in 1992, as it did in 1973, that abortion was a \\n\\u201cdivisive issue.\\u201d  Casey , 505 U. S., at 867\\u2013868; see Roe, 410 \\nU. S., at 116. But Casey \\u2019s reason for acknowledging public \\nconflict was the exact opposite of what the majority insinu-\\nates. Casey  addressed the national controversy in order to\\nemphasize how important it was, in that case of all cases,\\nfor the Court to stick to the law.  Would that today\\u2019s major-\\nity had done likewise.\\nConsider how the majority it self summarizes this aspect \\nof Casey : \\n\\u201cThe American people\\u2019s belief in the rule of law would be shaken if they lost respect for this Court as an insti-tution that decides important cases based on principle, not \\u2018social and political pressures.\\u2019 There is a special \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n 56 DOBBS v.

That is what the rule of law requires.\\nAnd that is what respect for this Court depends on. \\n\\u201cThe promise of constancy, once given\\u201d in so charged an\\nenvironment, Casey explained, \\u201cbinds its maker for as long \\nas\\u201d the \\u201cunderstanding of the issue has not changed so fun -\\ndamentally as to render the commitment obsolete.\\u201d Id., at \\n868.

And as Casey recognized, weak-\\nening stare decisis in a hotly contested case like this one\\ncalls into question this Court\\u2019 s commitment to legal princi-\\nple.

S. 52 APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI Syllabus Two Missouri licensed physicians, one of whom performs abortions at hospitals and the other of whom supervises abortions at Planned Parenthood, a notforprofit corporation, brought suit, along with that organization, for injunctive and declaratory relief challenging the constitutionality of the Missouri abortion statute. The provisions under attack are: 2(2), defining \\\"viability\\\" as \\\"that stage of fetal development when the life of the unborn child may be continued indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life supportive systems;\\\" 3(2), requiring that, before submitting to an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, a woman must consent in writing to the procedure and certify that \\\"her consent is informed and freely given, and is not the result of coercion\\\"; 3(3), requiring, for the same period, the written consent of the spouse of a woman seeking an abortion unless a licensed physician certifies that the abortion is necessary to preserve the mother's life; 3(4), requiring, for the same period, and with the same proviso, the written consent of a parent or person in loco pare ntis to the abortion of an unmarried woman under age 18; 6(1), requiring the physician to exercise professional care to preserve the fetus' life and health, failing which he is deemed guilty of manslaughter and is liable in an action for damages; 7, declaring an infant who survives an attempted abortion not performed to save the mother's life or health an abandoned ward of the State, and depriving the mother and a consenting father of parental rights; 9, prohibiting, after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, the abortion procedure of saline amniocentesis as \\\"deleterious to maternal health\\\"; and 10 and 11, prescribing reporting and record keeping Page 428 U. S. 53 requirements for health facilities and physicians performing abortions. The District Court ruled that the two physicians had \\\"obvious standing\\\" to maintain the suit, and that it was therefore unnecessary to determine if Planned Parenthood also had standing. On the merits, the court upheld the foregoing provisions with the exception of 6(1)'s professional skill requirement, which was held to be \\\"unconstitutionally overbroad\\\" because it failed to exclude the pregnancy stage prior to viability. Held: 1. The physician appellants have standing to challenge the foregoing provisions of the Act with the exception of 7, the constitutionality of which the Court declines to decide. Doe v. Bolt on, 410 U. S. 179. P. 428 U. S. 62, and n. 2. 2. The definition of viability in 2(2) does not conflict with the definition in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 410 U. S. 160, 410 U. S. 163, as the point at which the fetus is \\\"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid,\\\" and is presumably capable of \\\"meaningful life outside the mother's womb. \\\" Section 2(2) maintains the flexibility of the term \\\"viability\\\" recognized in Roe. It is not a proper legislative or judicial function to fix viability, which is essentially for the judgment of the responsible attending physician, at a specific point in the gestation period. P p. 428 U. S. 63-65. 3. The consent provision in 3(2) is not unconstitutional. The decision to abort is important and often stressful, and the awareness of the decision and its significance may be constitutionally assured by the State to the extent of requiring the woman's prior written consent. P p. 428 U. S. 65-67. 4. The spousal consent provision in 3(3), which does not comport with the standards enunciated in Roe v. Wade, supra, at 410 U. S. 164-165, is unconstitutional, since the State cannot \\\"'delegate to a spouse a veto power which the [S]tate itself is absolutely and totally prohibited from exercising during the first trimester of pregnancy. '\\\" P p. 428 U. S. 67-72. 5. The State may not constitutionally impose a blanket parental consent requirement, such as 3(4), as a condition for an unmarried minor's abortion during the first 12 weeks of her pregnancy for substantially the same reasons as in the case of the spousal consent provision, there being no significant state interests, whether to safeguard the family unit and parental authority or other vise, in conditioning an abortion on the consent of a parent with respect to the under-18-year-old pregnant minor. As stressed in Roe, \\\"the abortion decision and its effectuation must Page 428 U. S. 54 be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician. \\\" 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 164. P p. 428 U. S. 72-75. 6. Through 9, the State would prohibit the most commonly used abortion procedure in the country and one that is safer, with respect to maternal mortality, than even the continuation of pregnancy until normal childbirth, and would force pregnancy terminations by methods more dangerous to the woman's health than the method outlawed. As so viewed (particularly since another safe technique, prostaglandin, is not yet available) the outright legislative proscription of saline amniocentesis fails as a reasonable protection of maternal health. As an arbitrary regulation designed to prevent the vast majority of abortions after the first 12 weeks, it is plainly unconstitutional. P p. 428 U. S. 75-79. 7. The reporting and record keeping requirements, which can be useful to the State's interest in protecting the health of its female citizens and which may be of medical value, are not constitutionally offensive in themselves, particularly in view of reasonable confidentiality and retention provisions. They thus do not interfere with the abortion decision or the physician patient relationship. It is assumed that the provisions will not be administered in an unduly burdensome way, and that patients will not be required to execute spousal or parental consent forms in accordance with invalid provisions of the Act. P p. 428 U. S. 79-81. 8. The first sentence of 6(1) impermissibly requires a physician to preserve the fetus' life and health, whatever the stage of pregnancy. The second sentence, which provides for criminal and civil liability where a physician fails \\\"to take such measures to encourage or to sustain the life of the child, and the death of the child results,\\\" does not alter the duty imposed by the first sentence or limit that duty to pregnancies that have reached the stage of viability, and since it is inseparably tied to the first provision, the whole section is invalid. P p. 428 U. S. 81-84. 392 F. Sup p. 1362, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. BLACK MUN, J. ,delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BREN NAN, STEWART, MARSHALL, and POWELL, J J. ,joined, in all but Parts I VD and IV E of which STEVENS, J. ,joined, and in all but Parts IV C, I VD, IV E, and IV G of which BURGER, C.

S. 55 filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, post, p. 428 U. S. 101. MR. JUSTICE BLACK MUN delivered the opinion of the Court. This case is a logical and anticipated corollary to Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and Doe v. Bolt on, 410 U. S. 179 (1973), for it raises issues secondary to those that were then before the Court. Indeed, some of the questions now presented were forecast and reserved in Roe and Doe. 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 165 n. 67. I After the decisions in Roe and Doe, this Court remanded for reconsideration a pending Missouri federal case in which the State's then existing abortion legislation, Page 428 U. S. 56 Mo. Rev. S tat. 559. 100, 542. 380, and 563. 300 (1969), was under constitutional challenge. Rodgers v. Dan forth, 410 U. S. 949 (1973). A three judge federal court for the Western District of Missouri, in an unreported decision, thereafter declared the challenged Missouri statutes unconstitutional and granted injunctive relief. On appeal here, that judgment was summarily affirmed. Dan forth v. Rodgers, 414 U. S. 1035 (1973). In June, 1974, somewhat more than a year after Roe and Doe had been decided, Missouri's 77th General Assembly, in its Second Regular Session, enacted House Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1211 (hereinafter Act). The legislation was approved by the Governor on June 14, 1974, and became effective immediately by reason of an emergency clause contained in A of the statute. The Act is set forth in full as the 428 U. S. 52appAppendix to this opinion. It imposes a structure for the control and regulation of abortions in Missouri during all stages of pregnancy. II Three days after the Act became effective, the present litigation was instituted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. The plaintiffs are Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri, a notforprofit Missouri corporation which maintains a facility in Columbia, Mo. ,for the performance of abortions; David Hall, M. D. ;and Michael Freiman, M. D. Doctor Hall is a resident of Columbia, is licensed as a physician in Missouri, is chairman of the Department and Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Missouri Medical School at Columbia, and supervises abortions at the Planned Parenthood facility. He was described by the three judge court in the 1973 case as one of four plaintiffs who were \\\"eminent, Missouri licensed obstetricians and gynecologists. \\\" Jurisdictional Page 428 U. S. 57 Statement, App. 7, in Dan forth v. Rodgers, No. 73-426, O. T. 1973. Doctor Freiman is a resident of St. Louis, is licensed as a physician in Missouri, is an instructor of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology at Washington University Medical School, and performs abortions at two St. Louis hospitals and at a clinic in that city. The named defendants are the Attorney General of Missouri and the Circuit Attorney of the city of St. Louis \\\"in his representative capacity\\\" and \\\"as the representative of the class of all similar Prosecuting Attorneys of the various counties of the State of Missouri. \\\" Complaint 10. The plaintiffs brought the action on their own behalf and, purportedly, \\\"on behalf of the entire class consisting of duly licensed physicians and surgeons presently performing or desiring to perform the termination of pregnancies and on behalf of the entire class consisting of their patients desiring the termination of pregnancy, all within the State of Missouri. \\\" Id. at 9. Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and also sought to enjoin enforcement of the Act on the ground, among other s, that certain of its provisions deprived them and their patients of various constitutional rights: \\\"the right to privacy in the physician patient relationship\\\"; the physicians' \\\"right to practice medicine according to the highest standards of medical practice\\\"; the female patients' right to determine whether to bear children; the patients' \\\"right to life due to the inherent risk involved in childbirth\\\" or in medical procedures alternative to abortion; the physicians' \\\"right to give and plaintiffs' patients' right to receive safe and adequate medical advice and treatment pertaining to the decision of whether to carry a given pregnancy to term and the method of termination\\\"; the patients' right under the Eighth Amendment to be free from cruel and unusual punishment \\\"by forcing Page 428 U. S. 58 and coercing them to bear each pregnancy they conceive\\\"; and, by being placed \\\"in the position of decision making beset with inherent possibilities of bias and conflict of interest,\\\" the physician's right to due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 10-11. The particular provisions of the Act that remained under specific challenge at the end of trial were 2(2), defining the term \\\"viability\\\"; 3(2), requiring from the woman, prior to submitting to abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, a certification in writing that she consents to the procedure and \\\"that her consent is informed and freely given and is not the result of coercion\\\"; 3(3), requiring, for the same period, \\\"the written consent of the woman's spouse, unless the abortion is certified by a licensed physician to be necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother;\\\" 3(4), requiring, for the same period, \\\"the written consent of one parent or person in loco pare ntis of the woman if the woman is unmarried and under the age of eighteen years, unless the abortion is certified by a licensed physician as necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother;\\\" 6(1), requiring the physician to exercise professional care \\\"to preserve the life and health of the fetus\\\" and, failing such, deeming him guilty of manslaughter and making him liable in an action for damages; 7, declaring an infant who survives \\\"an attempted abortion which was not performed to save the life or health of the mother\\\" to be \\\"an abandoned ward of the state under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,\\\" and depriving the mother, and also the father if he consented to the abortion, of parental rights; 9, the legislative finding that the method of abortion known as saline amniocentesis \\\"is deleterious to maternal health,\\\" and prohibiting that method after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy; and 10 Page 428 U. S. 59 and 11, imposing reporting and maintenance of record requirements for health facilities and for physicians who perform abortions. The case was presented to a three judge District Court convened pursuant to the provisions of 28 U. S. C. 2281 and 2284. 392 F. Sup p. 1362 (1975). The court ruled that the two physician plaintiffs had standing, inasmuch as 6(1) provides that the physician who fails to exercise the prescribed standard of professional care due the fetus in the abortion procedure shall be guilty of manslaughter, and 14 provides that any person who performs or aids in the performance of an abortion contrary to the provisions of the Act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 392 F. Sup p. at 1366-1367. Due to this \\\"obvious standing\\\" of the two physicians, id. at 1367, the court deemed it unnecessary to determine whether Planned Parenthood also had standing. On the issues as to the constitutionality of the several challenged sections of the Act, the District Court, largely by a divided vote, ruled that all except the first sentence of 6(1) withstood the attack. That sentence was held to be constitutionally impermissible because it imposed upon the physician the duty to exercise at all stages of pregnancy \\\"that degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus\\\" that \\\"would be required to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born. \\\" Inasmuch as this failed to exclude the stage of pregnancy prior to viability, the provision was \\\"unconstitutionally over broad. \\\" 392 F. Sup p. at 1371. One judge concurred in part and dissented in part. Id. at 1374. He agreed with the majority as to the constitutionality of 2(2), 3(2), 10, and 11, respectively relating to the definition of \\\"viability,\\\" the woman's prior written consent, maintenance of records, Page 428 U. S. 60 and retention a f records. He also agreed with the majority that 6(1) was unconstitutionally over broad. He dissented from the majority opinion upholding the constitutionality of 3(3), 3(4), 7, and 9, relating, respectively, to spousal consent, parental consent, the termination of parental rights, and the proscription of saline amniocentesis. In No. 74-1151, the plaintiffs appeal from that part of the District Court's judgment upholding sections of the Act as constitutional and denying injunctive relief against their application and enforcement. In No. 74-1419, the defendant Attorney General cross appeals from that part of the judgment holding 6(1) unconstitutional and enjoining enforcement thereof. We granted the plaintiffs' application for stay of enforcement of the Act pending appeal. 420 U. S. 918 (1975). Probable jurisdiction of both appeals thereafter was noted. 423 U. S. 819 (1975). For convenience, we shall usually refer to the plaintiffs as \\\"appellants\\\" and to both named defendants as \\\"appellees. \\\" III In Roe v. Wade, the Court concluded that the \\\"right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. \\\" 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 153. It emphatically rejected, however, the proffered argument \\\"that the woman's right is absolute, and that she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way, and for whatever reason, she alone chooses. \\\" Ibid. Instead, Page 428 U. S. 61 this right \\\"must be considered against important state interests in regulation. \\\" Id. at 410 U. S. 154. The Court went on to say that the \\\"pregnant woman cannot be isolated in her privacy,\\\" for she \\\"carries an embryo and, later, a fetus. \\\" Id. at 410 U. S. 159. It was therefore \\\"reasonable and appropriate for a State to decide that, at some point in time, another interest, that of health of the mother or that of potential human life, becomes significantly involved. The woman's privacy is no longer sole, and any right of privacy she possesses must be measured accordingly. \\\" Ibid. The Court stressed the measure of the State's interest in \\\"the light of present medical knowledge. \\\" Id. at 410 U. S. 163. It concluded that the permissibility of state regulation was to be viewed in three stages: \\\"For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician,\\\" without interference from the State. Id. at 410 U. S. 164. The participation by the attending physician in the abortion decision, and his responsibility in that decision, thus, were emphasized. After the first stage, as so described, the State may, if it chooses, reasonably regulate the abortion procedure to preserve and protect maternal health. Ibid. Finally, for the stage subsequent to viability, a point purposefully left flexible for professional determination, and dependent upon developing medical skill and technical ability, [Footnote 1] the State may regulate an abortion to protect the life of the fetus and even may proscribe abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. Id. at 410 U. S. 163-165. Page 428 U. S. 62 IV With the exception specified in n 2, infra, we agree with the District Court that the physician appellants clearly have standing. This was established in Doe v. Bolt on, 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 188. Like the Georgia statutes challenged in that case, \\\"[t]he physician is the one against whom [the Missouri Act] directly operate[s] in the event he procures an abortion that does not meet the statutory exceptions and conditions. The physician appellants, therefore, assert a sufficiently direct threat of personal detriment. They should not be required to await and undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief. [Footnote 2]\\\" Ibid. Our primary task, then, is to consider each of the Page 428 U. S. 63 challenged provisions of the new Missouri abortion statute in the particular light of the opinions and decisions in Roe and in Doe. To this we now turn, with the assistance of helpful briefs from both sides and from some of the ami ci. A The definition of viability. Section 2(2) of the Act defines \\\"viability\\\" as \\\"that stage of fetal development when the life of the unborn child may be continued indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life supportive systems. \\\" Appellants claim that this definition violates and conflicts with the discussion of viability in our opinion in Roe. 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 160, 410 U. S. 163. In particular, appellants object to the failure of the definition to contain any reference to a gestational time period, to its failure to incorporate and reflect the three stages of pregnancy, to the presence of the word \\\"indefinitely,\\\" and to the extra burden of regulation imposed. It is suggested that the definition expands the Court's definition of viability, as expressed in Roe, and amounts to a legislative determination of what is properly a matter for medical judgment. It is said that the \\\"mere possibility of momentary survival is not the medical standard of viability. \\\" Brief for Appellants 67. In Roe, we used the term \\\"viable,\\\" properly we thought, to signify the point at which the fetus is \\\"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid,\\\" and presumably capable of \\\"meaningful life outside the mother's womb,\\\" 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 160, 410 U. S. 163. We noted that this point \\\"is usually placed\\\" at about seven months or 28 weeks, but may occur earlier. Id. at 410 U. S. 160. We agree with the District Court, and conclude that the definition of viability in the Act does not conflict with what was said and held in Roe. In fact, we believe that, Page 428 U. S. 64 2(2), even when read in conjunction with 5 (proscribing an abortion \\\"not necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother unless the attending physician first certifies with reasonable medical certainty that the fetus is not viable\\\"), the constitutionality of which is not explicitly challenged here, reflects an attempt on the part of the Missouri General Assembly to comply with our observations and discussion in Roe relating to viability. Appellant Hall, in his deposition, had no particular difficulty with the statutory definition. [Footnote 3] As noted above, we recognized in Roe that viability was a matter of medical judgment, skill, and technical ability, and we preserved the flexibility of the term. Section 2(2) does the same. Indeed, one might argue, as the appellee s do, that the presence of the statute's words \\\"continued indefinitely\\\" favor, rather than disfavor, the appellants, for, arguably, the point when life can be \\\"continued indefinitely outside the womb\\\" may well occur later in pregnancy than the point where the fetus is \\\"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb. \\\" Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 160. In any event, we agree with the District Court that it is not the proper function of the legislature or the courts to place viability, which essentially is a medical concept, at a specific point in the gestation period. The time when viability is achieved may vary with each pregnancy, and the determination of whether a particular fetus is viable is, and must be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician. The definition of viability in 2(2) merely reflects this fact. The appellee s do not contend otherwise, for they insist Page 428 U. S. 65 that the determination of viability rests with the physician in the exercise of his professional judgment. [Footnote 4] We thus do not accept appellants' contention that a specified number of weeks in pregnancy must be fixed by statute as the point of viability. See Wolfe v. Schroering, 388 F. Sup p. 631, 637 (W D Ky. 1974); Hodgson v. Anderson, 378 F. Sup p. 1008, 1016 (M inn. 1974), dismissed for want of jurisdiction sub n om. Spann aus v. Hodgson, 420 U. S. 903 (1975). [Footnote 5] We conclude that the definition in 2(2) of the Act does not circumvent the limitations on state regulation outlined in Roe. We therefore hold that the Act's definition of \\\"viability\\\" comports with Roe and withstands the constitutional attack made upon it in this litigation. B The woman's consent. Under 3(2) of the Act, a woman, prior to submitting to an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, must certify in writing her consent to the procedure and \\\"that her consent is informed and freely given, and is not the result of coercion. \\\" Appellants argue that this requirement is violative of Page 428 U. S. 66 Roe v. Wade,410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 164-165, by imposing an extra layer and burden of regulation on the abortion decision. See Doe v. Bolt on, 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 195-200. Appellants also claim that the provision is over broad and vague. The District Court's majority relied on the propositions that the decision to terminate a pregnancy, of course, \\\"is often a stressful one,\\\" and that the consent requirement of 3(2) \\\"insures that the pregnant woman retains control over the discretions of her consulting physician. \\\" 392 F. Sup p. at 1368, 1369. The majority also felt that the consent requirement \\\"does not single out the abortion procedure, but merely includes it within the category of medical operations for which consent is required. \\\" [Footnote 6] Id. at 1369. The third judge joined the majority in upholding 3(2), but added that the written consent requirement was \\\"not burdensome or chilling,\\\" and manifested \\\"a legitimate interest of the state that this important decision has in fact been made by the person constitutionally empowered to do so. \\\" 392 F. Sup p. at 1374. He went on to observe that the requirement \\\"in no way interposes the state or third parties in the decision making process. \\\" Id. at 1375. We do not disagree with the result reached by the District Court as to 3(2). It is true that Doe and Roe clearly establish that the State may not restrict the decision of the patient and her physician regarding abortion during the first stage of pregnancy. Despite the fact that apparently no other Missouri statute, with the exceptions referred to in n 6, supra, requires a Page 428 U. S. 67 patient's prior written consent to a surgical procedure, [Footnote 7] the imposition by 3(2) of such a requirement for termination of pregnancy even during the first stage, in our view, is not, in itself, an unconstitutional requirement. The decision to abort, indeed, is an important and often a stressful one, and it is desirable and imperative that it be made with full knowledge of its nature and consequences. The woman is the one primarily concerned, and her awareness of the decision and its significance may be assured, constitutionally, by the State to the extent of requiring her prior written consent. We could not say that a requirement imposed by the State that a prior written consent for any surgery would be unconstitutional. As a consequence, we see no constitutional defect in requiring it only for some types of surgery as, for example, an intracardiac procedure, or where the surgical risk is elevated above a specified mortality level, or, for that matter, for abortions. [Footnote 8] C The spouse's consent. Section 3(3) requires the prior written consent of the spouse of the woman seeking an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, unless Page 428 U. S. 68 \\\"the abortion is certified by a licensed physician to be necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother. \\\" [Footnote 9] The appellee s defend 3(3) on the ground that it was enacted in the light of the General Assembly's \\\"perception of marriage as an institution,\\\" Brief for Appellee Dan forth 34, and that any major change in family status is a decision to be made jointly by the marriage partners. Reference is made to an abortion's possible effect on the woman's childbearing potential. It is said that marriage always has entailed some legislatively imposed limitations: reference is made to adultery and bigamy as criminal offenses; to Missouri's general requirement, Mo. Rev. S tat. 453. 030. 3 (1969), that, for an adoption of a child born in wedlock, the consent of both parents is necessary; to similar joint consent requirements imposed by a number of States with respect to artificial insemination and the legitimacy of children so conceived; to the laws of two States requiring spousal consent for voluntary sterilization; and to the long established requirement of spousal consent for the effective disposition of an interest in real property. It is argued that \\\"[r]ecognizing that the consent of both parties is generally necessary to begin a family, the legislature has determined that a change in the family structure set in motion by mutual consent should be terminated only by mutual consent,\\\" Brief for Appellee Dan forth 38, and that what the legislature did was to exercise its inherent policy making power \\\"for what was believed to be in the best interests of all the people of Missouri. \\\" Id. at 40. The appellants, on the other hand, contend that 3(3) obviously is designed to afford the husband the right unilaterally to prevent or veto an abortion, whether or Page 428 U. S. 69 not he is the father of the fetus, and that this not only violates Roe and Doe, but is also in conflict with other decided cases. See, e. g. ,Poe v. Ger stein, 517 F. 2d 787, 794-796 (CA5 1975), appeal docketed, No. 75-713; Wolfe v. Schroering, 388 F. Sup p. at 636-637; Doe v. Ramp ton, 366 F. Sup p. 189, 193 (Utah 1973). They also refer to the situation where the husband's consent cannot be obtained because he cannot be located. And they assert that 3(3) is vague and over broad. In Roe and Doe, we specifically reserved decision on the question whether a requirement for consent by the father of the fetus, by the spouse, or by the parents, or a parent, of an unmarried minor, may be constitutionally imposed. 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 165 n. 67. We now hold that the State may not constitutionally require the consent of the spouse, as is specified under 3(3) of the Missouri Act, as a condition for abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. We thus agree with the dissenting judge in the present case, and with the courts whose decisions are cited above, that the State cannot \\\"delegate to a spouse a veto power which the state itself is absolutely and totally prohibited from exercising during the first trimester of pregnancy. \\\" 392 F. Sup p. at 1375. Clearly, since the State cannot regulate or proscribe abortion during the first stage, when the physician and his patient make that decision, the State cannot delegate authority to any particular person, even the spouse, g., Gris wold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, 381 U. S. 486 (1965); May nard v. Hill, 125 U. S. Page 428 U. S. 70 190, 125 U. S. 211 (1888). [Footnote 10] Moreover, we recognize that the decision whether to undergo or to forgo an abortion may have profound effects on the future of ay marriage, effects that are both physical and mental, and possibly deleterious. Notwithstanding these factors, we cannot hold that the State has the constitutional authority to give the spouse unilaterally the ability to prohibit the wife from terminating her pregnancy when the State itself lacks that right. See Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 405 U. S. 453 (1972). [Footnote 11] Page 428 U. S. 71 It seems manifest that, ideally, the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be one concurred in by both the wife and her husband. No marriage my be viewed as harmonious or successful if the marriage partners are fundamentally divided on so important and vital an issue. But it is difficult to believe that the goal of fostering mutuality and trust in a marriage, and of strengthening the marital relationship and the marriage institution, will be achieved by giving the husband a veto power exercisable for any reason whatsoever or for no reason at all. Even if the State had the ability to delegate to the husband a power it itself could not exercise, it is not at all likely that such action would further, as the District Court majority phrased it, the \\\"interest of the state in protecting the mutuality of decisions vital to the marriage relationship. \\\" 392 F. Sup p. at 1370. We recognize, of course, that, when a woman, with the approval of her physician but without the approval of her husband, decides to terminate her pregnancy, it could be said that she is acting unilaterally. The obvious fact is that, when the wife and the husband disagree on this decision, the view of only one of the two marriage partners can prevail. Inasmuch as it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy, as between the two, the balance weighs in her favor. Cf. Roe v Wade, 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 153. We conclude that 3(3) of the Missouri Act is inconsistent with the standards enunciated in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 164-165, and is unconstitutional. It is therefore unnecessary for us to consider the appellants' Page 428 U. S. 72 additional challenges to 3(3) based on vagueness and over breadth. D Parental consent. Section 3(4) requires, with respect to the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, where the woman is unmarried and under the age of 18 years, the written consent of a parent or person in loco pare ntis unless, again, \\\"the abortion is certified by a licensed physician as necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother. \\\" It is to be observed that only one parent need consent. The appellee s defend the statute in several ways. They point out that the law properly may subject minors to more stringent limitations than are permissible with respect to adults, and they cite, among other cases, Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158 (1944), and McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U. S. 528 (1971). Missouri law, it is said, \\\"is replete with provisions reflecting the interest of the state in assuring the welfare of minors,\\\" citing statutes relating to a guardian ad l item for a court proceeding, to the care of delinquent and neglected children, to child labor, and to compulsory education. Brief for Appellee Dan forth 42. Certain decisions are considered by the State to be outside the scope of a minor's ability to act in his own best interest or in the interest of the public, citing statutes proscribing the sale of firearms and deadly weapons to minors without parental consent, and other statutes relating to minors' exposure to certain types of literature, the purchase by pawnbrokers of property from minors, and the sale of cigarettes and alcoholic beverages to minors. It is pointed out that the record contains testimony to the effect that children of tender years (even ages 10 and 11) have sought abortions. Thus, a State's permitting a child to obtain an abortion without the counsel of an adult \\\"who has responsibility Page 428 U. S. 73 or concern for the child would constitute an irresponsible abdication of the State's duty to protect the welfare of minors. \\\" Id. at 44. Parental discretion, too, has been protected from unwarranted or unreasonable interference from the State, citing M eyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 (1923); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 (1925); Wisconsin v. Y oder, 406 U. S. 205 (1972). Finally, it is said that 3(4) imposes no additional burden on the physician, because, even prior to the passage of the Act, the physician would require parental consent before performing an abortion on a minor. The appellants, in their turn, emphasize that no other Missouri statute specifically requires the additional consent of a minor's parent for medical or surgical treatment, and that, in Missouri, a minor legally may consent to medical services for pregnancy (excluding abortion), venereal disease, and drug abuse. Mo. Rev. S tat. 431. 061-431. 063 (Sup p. 1975). The result of 3(4), it is said, \\\"is the ultimate supremacy of the parents' desires over those of the minor child, the pregnant patient. \\\" Brief for Appellants 93. It is noted that, in Missouri, a woman under the age of 18 who marries with parental consent does not require parental consent to abort, and yet her contemporary who has chosen not to marry must obtain parental approval. The District Court majority recognized that, in contrast to 3(3), the State's interest in protecting the mutuality of a marriage relationship is not present with respect to 3(4). It found \\\"a compelling basis,\\\" however, in the State's interest \\\"in safeguarding the authority of the family relationship. \\\" 392 F. Sup p. at 1370. The dissenting judge observed that one could not seriously argue that a minor must submit to an abortion if her parents insist, and he could not see \\\"why she would not be entitled to the same right of self determination now Page 428 U. S. 74 explicitly accorded to adult women, provided she is sufficiently mature to understand the procedure and to make an intelligent assessment of her circumstances with the advice of her physician. \\\" Id. at 1376. Of course, much of what has been said above, with respect to 3(3) applies with equal force to 3(4). Other courts that have considered the parental consent issue in the light of Roe and Doe, have concluded that a statute like 3(4) does not withstand constitutional scrutiny. See, e. g. ,Poe v. Ger stein, 517 F. 2d at 792; Wolfe v. Schroering, 388 F. Sup p. at 636-637; Doe v. Ramp ton, 366 F. Sup p. at 193, 199; State v. Koome, 84 Wash. 2d 901, 530 P. 2d 260 (1975). We agree with appellants and with the courts whose decisions have just been cited that the State may not impose a blanket provision, such as 3(4), requiring the consent of a parent or person in loco pare ntis as a condition for abortion of an unmarried minor during the first 12 weeks of her pregnancy. Just as with the requirement of consent from the spouse, so here, the State does not have the constitutional authority to give a third party an absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto over the decision of the physician and his patient to terminate the patient's pregnancy, regardless of the reason for withholding the consent. Constitutional rights do not mature and come into being magically only when one attains the state defined age of majority. Minors, as well as adults, are protected by the Constitution, and possess constitutional rights. See, e. g. ,Breed v. Jones, 421 U. S. 519 (1975); Goss v. Lope z, 419 U. S. 565 (1975); Tinker v. Des Moines School D ist. , 393 U. S. 503 (1969); In re Gault, 387 U. S. 1 (1967). The Court indeed, however, long has recognized that the State has somewhat broader authority to regulate the activities of children than of adults. Page 428 U. S. 75 Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. at 321 U. S. 170; Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629 (1968). It remains, then, to examine whether there is any significant state interest in conditioning an abortion on the consent of a parent or person in loco pare ntis that is not present in the case of an adult. One suggested interest is the safeguarding of the family unit and of parental authority. 392 F. Sup p. at 1370. It is difficult, however, to conclude that providing a parent with absolute power to overrule a determination, made by the physician and his minor patient, to terminate the patient's pregnancy will serve to strengthen the family unit. Neither is it likely that such veto power will enhance parental authority or control where the minor and the nonconsenting parent are so fundamentally in conflict and the very existence of the pregnancy already has fractured the family structure. Any independent interest the parent may have in the termination of the minor daughter's pregnancy is no more weighty than the right of privacy of the competent minor mature enough to have become pregnant. We emphasize that our holding that 3(4) is invalid does not suggest that every minor, regardless of age or maturity, may give effective consent for termination of her pregnancy. See Bellotti v. Baird, post, p. 428 U. S. 132. The fault with 3(4) is that it imposes a special consent provision, exercisable by a person other than the woman and her physician, as a prerequisite to a minor's termination of her pregnancy, and does so without a sufficient justification for the restriction. It violates the strictures of Roe and Doe. E Saline amniocentesis. Section 9 of the statute prohibits the use of saline amniocentesis, as a method or technique of abortion, after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Page 428 U. S. 76 It describes the method as one whereby the amniotic fluid is withdrawn and \\\"a saline or other fluid\\\" is inserted into the amniotic sac. The statute imposes this proscription on the ground that the technique \\\"is deleterious to maternal health,\\\" and places it in the form of a legislative finding. Appellants challenge this provision on the ground that it operates to preclude virtually all abortions after the first trimester. This is so, it is claimed, because a substantial percentage, in the neighborhood of 70 according to the testimony, of all abortions performed in the United States after the first trimester are effected through the procedure of saline amniocentesis. Appellants stress the fact that the alternative methods of hysterotomy and hysterectomy are significantly more dangerous and critical for the woman than the saline technique; they also point out that the mortality rate for normal childbirth exceeds that where saline amniocentesis is employed. Finally, appellants note that the perhaps safer alternative of prostaglandin instillation, suggested and strongly relied upon by the appellee s, at least at the time of the trial, is not yet widely used in this country. We held in Roe that, after the first stage, \\\"the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. \\\" 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 164. The question with respect to 9 therefore is whether the flat prohibition of saline amniocentesis is a restriction which \\\"reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health. \\\" Id. at 410 U. S. 163. The appellee s urge that what the Missouri General Assembly has done here is consistent with that guideline, and is buttressed by substantial supporting medical evidence in the record to which this Court should defer. Page 428 U. S. 77 The District Court's majority determined, on the basis of the evidence before it, that the maternal mortality rate in childbirth does, indeed, exceed the morality rate where saline amniocentesis is used. Therefore, the majority acknowledged, 9 could be upheld only if there were safe alternative methods of inducing abortion after the first 12 weeks. 392 F. Sup p. at 1373. Referring to such methods as hysterotomy, hysterectomy, \\\"mechanical means of inducing abortion,\\\" and prostaglandin injection, the majority said that at least the latter two techniques were safer than saline. Consequently, the majority concluded, the restriction in 9 could be upheld as reasonably related to maternal health. We feel that the majority, in reaching its conclusion, failed to appreciate and to consider several significant facts. First, it did not recognize the prevalence, as the record conclusively demonstrates, of the use of saline amniocentesis as an accepted medical procedure in this country; the procedure, as noted above, is employed in a substantial majority (the testimony from both sides ranges from 68 to 80) of all postfirsttrimester abortions. Second, it failed to recognize that, at the time of trial, there were severe limitations on the availability of the prostaglandin technique, which, although promising, was used only on an experimental basis until less than two years before. See Wolfe v. Schroerin, 388 F. Sup p. at 637, where it was said that at that time (1974), there were \\\"no physicians in Kentucky competent in the technique of prostaglandin amnio infusion. \\\" And appellee s offered no evidence that prostaglandin abortions were available in Missouri. [Footnote 12] Third, the statute's Page 428 U. S. 78 reference to the insertion of \\\"a saline or other fluid\\\" appears to include within its proscription the intraamniotic injection of prostaglandin itself, and other methods that may be developed in the future and that may prove highly effective and completely safe. Finally, the majority did not consider the anomaly inherent in 9 when it proscribes the use of saline, but does not prohibit techniques that are many times more likely to result in maternal death. See 392 F. Sup p. at 1378 n. 8 (dissenting opinion). These unappreciated or overlooked factors place the State's decision to bar use of the saline method in a completely different light. The State, through 9, would prohibit the use of a method which the record shows is the one most commonly used nationally by physicians after the first trimester, and which is safer, with respect to maternal mortality, than even continuation of the pregnancy until normal childbirth. Moreover, Page 428 U. S. 79 as a practical matter, it forces a woman and her physician to terminate her pregnancy by methods more dangerous to her health than the method outlawed. As so viewed, particularly in the light of the present unavailability as demonstrated by the record of the prostaglandin technique, the outright legislative proscription of saline fails as a reasonable regulation for the protection of maternal health. It comes into focus, instead, as an unreasonable or arbitrary regulation designed to inhibit, and having the effect of inhibiting, the vast majority of abortions after the first 12 weeks. As such, it does not withstand constitutional challenge. See Wolfe v. Schroering, 388 F. Sup p. at 637. F Record keeping. Sections 10 and 11 of the Act impose record keeping requirements for health facilities and physicians concerned with abortions irrespective of the pregnancy stage. Under 10, each such facility and physician is to be supplied with forms \\\"the purpose and function of which shall be the preservation of maternal health and life by adding to the sum of medical knowledge through the compilation of relevant maternal health and life data and to monitor all abortions performed to assure that they are done only under and in accordance with the provisions of the law. \\\" The statute states that the information on the forms \\\"shall be confidential and shall be used only for statistical purposes. \\\" The \\\"records, however, may be inspected and health data acquired by local, state, or national public health officers. \\\" Under 11, the records are to be kept for seven years in the permanent files of the health facility where the abortion was performed. Appellants object to these reporting and record keeping provisions on the ground that they, too, impose an extra Page 428 U. S. 80 layer and burden of regulation, and that they apply throughout all stages of pregnancy. All the judges of the District Court panel, however, viewed these provisions as statistical requirements \\\"essential to the advancement of medical knowledge,\\\" and as nothing that would \\\"restrict either the abortion decision itself or the exercise of medical judgment in performing an abortion. \\\" 392 F. Sup p. at 1374. One may concede that there are important and perhaps conflicting interests affected by record keeping requirements. On the one hand, maintenance of records indeed may be helpful in developing information pertinent to the preservation of maternal health. On the other hand, as we stated in Roe, during the first stage of pregnancy, the State may impose no restrictions or regulations governing the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician with respect to the termination of her pregnancy. 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 163, 410 U. S. 164. Furthermore, it is readily apparent that one reason for the record keeping requirement, namely, to assure that all abortions in Missouri are performed in accordance with the Act, fades somewhat into insignificance in view of our holding above as to spousal and parental consent requirements. Record keeping and reporting requirements that are reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health and that properly respect a patient's confidentiality and privacy are permissible. This surely is so for the period after the first stage of pregnancy, for then the State may enact substantive as well as record keeping regulations that are reasonable means of protecting maternal health. As to the first stage, one may argue forcefully, as the appellants do, that the State should not be able to impose any record keeping requirements that significantly differ from those imposed with respect to other, Page 428 U. S. 81 and comparable, medical or surgical procedures. We conclude, however, that the provisions of 10 and 11, while perhaps approaching impermissible limits, are not constitutionally offensive in themselves. Record keeping of this kind, if not abused or overdone, can be useful to the State's interest in protecting the health of its female citizens, and may be a resource that is relevant to decisions involving medical experience and judgment. [Footnote 13] The added requirements for confidentiality, with the sole exception for public health officers, and for retention for seven years, a period not unreasonable in length, assist and persuade us in our determination of the constitutional limits. As so regarded, we see no legally significant impact or consequence on the abortion decision or on the physician patient relationship. We naturally assume, furthermore, that these record keeping and record maintaining provisions will be interpreted and enforced by Missouri's Division of Health in the light of our decision with respect to the Act's other provisions, and that, of course, they will not be utilized in such a way as to accomplish, through the sheer burden of record keeping detail, what we have held to be an otherwise unconstitutional restriction. Obviously, the State may not require execution of spousal and parental consent forms that have been invalidated today. G Standard of care. Appellee Dan forth in No. 74-1419 appeals from the unanimous decision of the District Page 428 U. S. 82 Court that (1) of the Act is unconstitutional. That section provides: \\\"No person who performs or induces an abortion shall fail to exercise that degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus which such person would be required to exercise in order to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born and not aborted. Any physician or person assisting in the abortion who shall fail to take such measures to encourage or to sustain the life of the child, and the death of the child results, shall be deemed guilty of manslaughter. Further, such physician or other person shall be liable in an action for damages. \\\" The District Court held that the first sentence was unconstitutionally over broad because it failed to exclude from its reach the stage of pregnancy prior to viability. 392 F. Sup p. at 1371. The Attorney General argues that the District Court's interpretation is erroneous and unnecessary. He claims that the first sentence of 6(1) establishes only the general standard of care that applies to the person who performs the abortion, and that the second sentence describes the circumstances when that standard of care applies, namely, when a live child results from the procedure. Thus, the first sentence, it is said, despite its reference to the fetus, has no application until a live birth results. The appellants, of course, agree with the District Court. They take the position that 6(1) imposes its standard of care upon the person performing the abortion even though the procedure takes place before viability. They argue that the statute, on its face, effectively precludes abortion, and was meant to do just that. Page 428 U. S. 83 We see nothing that requires federal court abstention on this issue. Wisconsin v. Constantine au, 400 U. S. 433, 400 U. S. 437-439 (1971); Kusper v. Pon tikes, 414 U. S. 51,5 414 U. S. 4-55 (1973). And, like the three judges of the District Court, we are unable to accept the appellee's sophisticated interpretation of the statute. Section 6(1) requires the physician to exercise the prescribed skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus. It does not specify that such care need be taken only after the stage of viability has been reached. As the provision now reads, it impermissibly requires the physician to preserve the life and health of the fetus, whatever the stage of pregnancy. The fact that the second sentence of 6(1) refers to a criminal penalty where the physician fails \\\"to take such measures to encourage or to sustain the life of the child, and the death of the child results\\\" (emphasis supplied), simply does not modify the duty imposed by the previous sentence or limit that duty to pregnancies that have reached the stage of viability. The appellee s finally argue that, if the first sentence of 6(1) does not survive constitutional attack, the second sentence does, and, under the Act's sever ability provision, B, is severable from the first. The District Court's ruling of unconstitutionality, 392 F. Sup p. at 1371, made specific reference to the first sentence, but its conclusion of law and its judgment invalidated all of 6(1). Id. at 1374; Jurisdictional Statement A-34 in No. 74-1419. Appellee Danforth's motion to alter or amend the judgment, so far as the second sentence of 6(1) was concerned, was denied by the District Court. Id. at A-39. We conclude, as did the District Court, that 6(1) must stand or fall as a unit. Its provisions are inextricably bound together. And a physician's or other person's criminal failure to protect a liveborn infant surely Page 428 U. S. 84 will be subject to prosecution in Missouri under the State's criminal statutes. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. 428 U. S. 52app APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT H. C. S. HOUSE BILL No. 1211 AN ACT relating to abortion with penalty provisions and emergency clause. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Missouri, as follows: Section 1. It is the intention of the general assembly of the state of Missouri to reasonably regulate abortion in conformance with the decisions of the supreme court of the United States. Section 2. Unless the language or context clearly indicates a different meaning is intended, the following words or phrases for the purpose of this act shall be given the meaning ascribed to them: (1) \\\"Abortion,\\\" the intentional destruction of the life of an embryo or fetus in his or her mother's womb or the intentional termination of the pregnancy of a mother with an intention other than to increase the probability of a live birth or to remove a dead or dying unborn child; (2) \\\"Viability,\\\" that stage of fetal development when the life of the unborn child may be continued indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial life supportive systems; (3) \\\"Physician,\\\" any person licensed to practice medicine Page 428 U. S. 85 in this state by the state board of registration of the healing arts. Section 3. No abortion shall be performed prior to the end of the first twelve weeks of pregnancy except: (1) By a duly licensed, consenting physician in the exercise of his best clinical medical judgment. (2) After the woman, prior to submitting to the abortion, certifies in writing her consent to the abortion and that her consent is informed and freely given and is not the result of coercion. (3) With the written consent of the woman's spouse, unless the abortion is certified by a licensed physician to be necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother. (4) With the written consent of one parent or person in loco pare ntis of the woman if the woman is unmarried and under the age of eighteen years, unless the abortion is certified by a licensed physician as necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother. Section 4. No abortion performed subsequent to the first twelve weeks of pregnancy shall be performed except where the provisions of section 3 of this act are satisfied and in a hospital. Section 5. No abortion not necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother shall be performed unless the attending physician first certifies with reasonable medical certainty that the fetus is not viable. Section 6. (1) No person who performs or induces an abortion shall fail to exercise that degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus which such person would be required to exercise in order to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born and not aborted. Any physician or person assisting in the abortion who Page 428 U. S. 86 shall fail to take such measures to encourage or to sustain the life of the child, and the death of the child results, shall be deemed guilty of manslaughter and upon conviction shall be punished as provided in Section 559. 140, RS Mo. Further, such physician or other person shall be liable in an action for damages as provided in Section 537. 080, RS Mo. (2) Whoever, with intent to do so, shall take the life of a premature infant aborted alive, shall be guilty of murder of the second degree. (3) No person shall use any fetus or premature infant aborted alive for any type of scientific, research, laboratory or other kind of experimentation either prior to or subsequent to any abortion procedure except as necessary to protect or preserve the life and health of such premature infant aborted alive. Section 7. In every case where a live born infant results from an attempted abortion which was not performed to save the life or health of the mother, such infant shall be an abandoned ward of the state under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court wherein the abortion occurred, and the mother and father, if he consented to the abortion, of such infant, shall have no parental rights or obligations whatsoever relating to such infant, as if the parental rights had been terminated pursuant to section 211. 411, RS Mo. The attending physician shall forthwith notify said juvenile court of the existence of such live born infant. Section 8. Any woman seeking an abortion in the state of Missouri shall be verbally informed of the provisions of section 7 of this act by the attending physician and the woman shall certify in writing that she has been so informed. Section 9. The general assembly finds that the method or technique of abortion known as saline amniocentesis Page 428 U. S. 87 whereby the amniotic fluid is withdrawn and a saline or other fluid is inserted into the amniotic sac for the purpose of killing the fetus and artificially inducing labor is deleterious to maternal health and is hereby prohibited after the first twelve weeks of pregnancy. Section 10. 1. Every health facility and physician shall be supplied with forms promulgated by the division of health, the purpose and function of which shall be the preservation of maternal health and life by adding to the sum of medical knowledge through the compilation of relevant maternal health and life data and to monitor all abortions performed to assure that they are done only under and in accordance with the provisions of the law. 2. The forms shall be provided by the state division of health. 3. All information obtained by physician, hospital, clinic or other health facility from a patient for the purpose of preparing reports to the division of health under this section or reports received by the division of health shall be confidential and shall be used only for statistical purposes. Such records, however, may be inspected and health data acquired by local, state, or national public health officers. Section 11. All medical records and other documents required to be kept shall be maintained in the permanent files of the health facility in which the abortion was performed for a period of seven years. Section 12. Any practitioner of medicine, surgery, or nursing, or other health personnel who shall willfully and knowingly do or assist any action made unlawful by this act shall be subject to having his license, application for license, or authority to practice his profession as a physician, surgeon, or nurse in the state of Missouri Page 428 U. S. 88 rejected or revoked by the appropriate state licensing board. Section 13. Any physician or other person who fails to maintain the confidentiality of any records or reports required under this act is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished as provided by law. Section 14. Any person who contrary to the provisions of this act knowingly performs or aids in the performance of any abortion or knowingly fails to perform any action required by this act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished as provided by law. Section 15. Any person who is not a licensed physician as defined in section 2 of this act who performs or attempts to perform an abortion on another as defined in subdivision (1) of section 2 of this act, is guilty of a felony, and upon conviction, shall be imprisoned by the department of corrections for a term of not less than two years nor more than seventeen years. Section 16. Nothing in this act shall be construed to exempt any person, firm, or corporation from civil liability for medical malpractice for negligent acts or certification under this act. Section A. Because of the necessity for immediate state action to regulate abortions to protect the lives and health of citizens of this state, this act is deemed necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health, welfare, peace and safety, and is hereby declared to be an emergency act within the meaning of the constitution, and this act shall be in full force and effect upon its passage and approval. Section B. If any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall be Page 428 U. S. 89 held invalid, such invalidity does not affect the provisions or application of this Act which can be given effect without the invalid provisions or applications, and to this end the provisions of this Act are declared to be severable. Approved June 14, 1974. Effective June 14, 1974. Together with No. 74-1419, Dan forth, Attorney General of Missouri v. Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri e t al. ,also on appeal from the same court. [Footnote 1] \\\"Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks), but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks. \\\" Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 160. [Footnote 2] This is not so, however, with respect to 7 of the Act, pertaining to state wardship of a liveborn infant. Section 7 applies \\\"where a live born infant results from an attempted abortion which was not performed to save the life or health of the mother. \\\" It then provides that the infant \\\"shall be an abandoned ward of the state,\\\" and that the mother and the father, too, if he consented to the abortion \\\"shall have no parental rights or obligations whatsoever relating to such infant. \\\" The physician appellants do not contend that this section of the Act imposes any obligation on them, or that its operation otherwise injures them in fact. They do not claim any interest in the question of who receives custody that is \\\"sufficiently concrete\\\" to satisfy the \\\"case or controversy\\\" requirement of a federal court's Art. III jurisdiction. Singleton v. Wulff, post at 428 U. S. 112. Accordingly, the physician appellants do not have standing to challenge 7 of the Act. The District Court did not decide whether Planned Parenthood has standing to challenge the Act, or any portion of it, because of its view that the physician appellants have standing to challenge the entire Act. 392 F. Sup p. 1362, 1366-1367 (1975). We decline to consider here the standing of Planned Parenthood to attack 7. That question appropriately may be left to the District Court for reconsideration on remand. As a consequence, we do not decide the issue of 7's constitutionality. [Footnote 3] \\\"[A]lthough I agree with the definition of viability,' I think that it must be understood that viability is a very difficult state to assess. \\\" T r. 369. [Footnote 4] \\\"The determination of when the fetus is viable rests, as it should, with the physician, in the exercise of his medical judgment, on a casebycase basis. \\\" Brief for Appellee Dan forth 26. \\\"Because viability may vary from patient to patient and with advancements in medical technology, it is essential that physicians make the determination in the exercise of their medical judgment. \\\" Id. at 28. \\\"Defendant agrees that viability' will vary, that it is a difficult state to assess and that it must be left to the physician's judgment. \\\" Id. at 29. [Footnote 5] The Minnesota statute under attack in Hodgson provided that a fetus \\\"shall be considered potentially viable'\\\" during the second half of its gestation period. Noting that the defendants had presented no evidence of viability at 20 weeks, the three judge District Court held that that definition of viability was \\\"unreasonable, and cannot stand. \\\" 378 F. Sup p. at 1016. [Footnote 6] Apparently, however, the only other Missouri statutes concerned with consent for general medical or surgical care relate to persons committed to the Missouri State chest hospital, Mo. Rev. S tat. 199. 240 (Sup p. 1975), or to mental or correctional institutions, 105. 700 (1969). [Footnote 7] There is some testimony in the record to the effect that taking from the patient a prior written consent to surgery is the custom. That may be so in some areas of Missouri, but we definitely refrain from characterizing it extremely as \\\"the universal practice of the medical profession,\\\" as the appellee s do. Brief for Appellee Dan forth 32. [Footnote 8] The appellants' vagueness argument centers on the word \\\"informed. \\\" One might well wonder, offhand, just what \\\"informed consent\\\" of a patient is. The three Missouri federal judges who composed the three judge District Court, however, were not concerned, and we are content to accept, as the meaning, the giving of information to the patient as to just what would be done and as to its consequences. To ascribe more meaning than this might well confine the attending physician in an undesired and uncomfortable straitjacket in the practice of his profession. [Footnote 9] It is of some interest to note that the condition does not relate, as most statutory conditions in this area do, to the preservation of the life or health of the mother. [Footnote 10] We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights older than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions. Gris wold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. at 381 U. S. 486. [Footnote 11] As the Court recognized in Eisenstadt v. Baird, \\\"the marital couple is not an independent entity with a mind and heart of its own, but an association of two individuals, each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child. \\\" 405 U. S. at 405 U. S. 453 (emphasis in original). The dissenting opinion of our Brother WHITE appears to overlook the implications of this statement upon the issue whether 3(3) is constitutional. This section does much more than insure that the husband participate in the decision whether his wife should have an abortion. The State, instead, has determined that the husband's interest in continuing the pregnancy of his wife always outweighs any interest on her part in terminating it, irrespective of the condition of their marriage. The State, accordingly, has granted him the right to prevent unilaterally, and for whatever reason, the effectuation of his wife's and her physician's decision to terminate her pregnancy. This state determination not only may discourage the consultation that might normally be expected to precede a major decision affecting the marital couple, but also, and more importantly, the State has interposed an absolute obstacle to a woman's decision that Roe held to be constitutionally protected from such interference. [Footnote 12] In response to MR. JUSTICE WHITE's criticism that the prostaglandin method of inducing abortion was available in Missouri, either at the time the Act was passed or at the time of trial, we make the following observations. First, there is no evidence in the record to which our Brother has pointed that demonstrates that the prostaglandin method was or is available in Missouri. Second, the evidence presented to the District Court does not support such a view. Until January, 1974, prostaglandin was used only on an experimental basis in a few medical centers. And, at the time the Missouri General Assembly proscribed saline, the sole distributor of prostaglandin \\\"restricted sales to around twenty medical centers from coast to coast. \\\" Brief for Appellee Dan forth 68. It is clear, therefore, that, at the time the Missouri General Assembly passed the Act, prostaglandin was not available in any meaningful sense of that term. Because of this undisputed fact, it was incumbent upon appellee s to show that, at the time of trial in 1974, prostaglandin was available. They failed to do so. Indeed, appellees' expert witness, on whose testimony the dissenting opinion relies, does not fill this void. He was able to state only that prostaglandin was used in a limited way until shortly before trial, and that he \\\"would think\\\" that it was more readily available at the time of trial. T r. 335. Such an experimental and limited use of prostaglandin throughout the country does not make it available or accessible to concerned persons in Missouri. [Footnote 13] We note that in Missouri physicians must participate in the reporting of births and deaths, Mo. Rev. S tat. 193. 100 and 193. 140 (1969), and communicable diseases, 192. 020 and 192. 040 (1969), and that their use of controlled substances is rigidly monitored by the State, 195. 010-195. 545 (1969 and Sup p. 1975). MR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE POWELL joins, concurring. While joining the Court's opinion, I write separately to indicate my understanding of some of the constitutional issues raised by this litigation. With respect to the definition of viability in 2(2) of the Act, it seems to me that the critical consideration is that the statutory definition has almost no operative significance. The State has merely required physicians performing abortions to certify that the fetus to be aborted is not viable. While the physician may be punished for failing to issue a certification, he may not be punished for erroneously concluding that the fetus is not viable. There is thus little chance that a physician's professional decision to perform an abortion will be \\\"chilled. \\\" I agree with the Court that the patient consent provision in 3(2) is constitutional. While 3(2) obviously regulates the abortion decision during all stages of pregnancy, including the first trimester, I do not believe it conflicts with the statement in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 410 U. S. 163, that, \\\"for the period of pregnancy prior to [approximately the end of the first trimester], the attending physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the State, that, in his medical judgment, the patient's pregnancy should be terminated. If that decision is reached, the judgment Page 428 U. S. 90 may be effectuated by an abortion free of interference by the State. \\\" That statement was made in the context of invalidating a state law aimed at thwarting a woman's decision to have an abortion. It was not intended to preclude the State from enacting a provision aimed at ensuring that the abortion decision is made in a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary fashion. As to the provision of the law that requires a husband's consent to an abortion, 3(3), the primary issue that it raises is whether the State may constitutionally recognize and give effect to a right on his part to participate in the decision to abort a jointly conceived child. This seems to me a rather more difficult problem than the Court acknowledges. Previous decisions have recognized that a man's right to father children and enjoy the association of his offspring is a constitutionally protected freedom. See Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williams on, 316 U. S. 535. But the Court has recognized as well that the Constitution protects \\\"a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. \\\" Roe v. Wade, supra at 410 U. S. 153 (emphasis added). In assessing the constitutional validity of 3(3), we are called upon to choose between these competing rights. I agree with the Court that, since \\\"it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy ,the balance weighs in her favor. \\\" Ante at 428 U. S. 71. With respect to the state law's requirement of parental consent, 3(4), I think it clear that its primary constitutional deficiency lies in its imposition of an absolute limitation on the minor's right to obtain an abortion. The Court's opinion today in Bellotti v. Baird, post at 428 U. S. 147-148, suggests that a materially different constitutional issue would be presented under a provision requiring parental consent or consultation in most cases Page 428 U. S. 91 but providing for prompt (i) judicial resolution of any disagreement between the parent and the minor, or (ii) judicial determination that the minor is mature enough to give an informed consent without parental concurrence or that abortion in any event is in the minor's best interest. Such a provision would not impose parental approval as an absolute condition upon the minor's right, but would assure in most instances consultation between the parent and child. [Footnote 21] There can be little doubt that the State furthers a constitutionally permissible end by encouraging an unmarried pregnant minor to seek the help and advice of her parents in making the very important decision whether or not to bear a child. That is a grave decision, and a girl of tender years, under emotional stress, may be ill equipped to make it without mature advice and emotional support. It seems unlikely that she will obtain adequate counsel and support from the attending physician at an abortion clinic, where abortions for pregnant minors frequently take place. [Footnote 22] Page 428 U. S. 92 As to the constitutional validity of 9 of the Act, prohibiting the use of the saline amniocentesis procedure, I agree fully with the views expressed by MR. JUSTICE STEVENS. [Footnote 21] For some of the considerations that support the State's interest in encouraging parental consent, see the opinion of MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part. Post at 428 U. S. 102-105. [Footnote 22] The mode of operation of one such clinic is revealed by the record in Bellotti v. Baird, post, p. 428 U. S. 132, and accurately described by appellants in that case: \\\"The counseling occurs entirely on the day the abortion is to be performed. It lasts for two hours, and takes place in groups that include both minors and adults who are strangers to one another. The physician takes no part in this counseling process. Counseling is typically limited to a description of abortion procedures, possible complications, and birth control techniques. \\\". \\\"The abortion itself takes five to seven minutes. The physician has no prior contact with the minor, and on the days that abortions are being performed at the [clinic], the physician, may be performing abortions on many other adults and minors. On busy days, patients are scheduled in separate groups, consisting usually of five patients. After the abortion, [the physician] spends a brief period with the minor and other s in the group in the recovery room. \\\". Brief for Appellants in No. 773, O. T. 1975, p p. 43 44. MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join, concurring in part and dissenting in part. In Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1073), this Court recognized a right to an abortion free from state prohibition. The task of policing this limitation on state police power is and will be a difficult and continuing venture in substantive due process. However, even accepting Roe v. Wade, there is nothing in the opinion in that case, and nothing articulated in the Court's opinion in this case, which justifies the invalidation of four provisions of House Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1211 (hereafter Act) enacted by the Missouri 77th General Assembly in 1974 in response to Roe v. Wade. Accordingly, I dissent in part. I Roe v. Wade, supra at 410 U. S. 163, holds that, until a fetus becomes viable, the interest of the State in the life or potential life it represents is outweighed by the interest of the mother in choosing \\\"whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. \\\" 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 153. Section 3(3) of the Act provides that a married woman may not obtain an abortion without her husband's consent. The Court strikes down this statute in one sentence. It says that, \\\"since the State cannot proscribe abortion the State cannot delegate authority to any particular person, Page 428 U. S. 93 even the spouse, to prevent abortion. \\\". Ante at 428 U. S. 69. But the State is not under 3(3) delegating to the husband the power to vindicate the State's interest in the future life of the fetus. It is, instead, recognizing that the husband has an interest of his own in the life of the fetus which should not be extinguished by the unilateral decision of the wife. [Footnote 31] It by no means follows, from the fact that the mother's interest in deciding \\\"whether or not to terminate her pregnancy\\\" outweighs the State's interest in the potential life of the fetus, that the husband's interest is also outweighed, and may not be protected by the State. A father's interest in having a child perhaps his only child may be unmatched by any other interest in his life. See Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 405 U. S. 651 (1972), and cases there cited. It is truly surprising that the majority finds in the United States Constitution, as it must in order to justify the result it reaches, a rule that the State must assign a greater value to a mother's decision to cut off a potential human life by abortion than to a father's decision to let it mature into a live child. Such a rule cannot be found there, nor can it be found in Roe v. Wade, supra. These are matters which a State should be able to decide free from the suffocating power of the federal judge, purporting to act in the name of the Constitution. Page 428 U. S. 94 In describing the nature of a mother's interest in terminating a pregnancy, the Court in Roe v. Wade mentioned only the post birth burdens of rearing a child, 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 153, and rejected a rule based on her interest in controlling her own body during pregnancy. Id. at 410 U. S. 154. Missouri has a law which prevents a woman from putting a child up for adoption over her husband's objection, Mo. Rev. S tat. 453. 030 (1969). This law represents a judgment by the State that the mother's interest in avoiding the burdens of child rearing do not outweigh or snuff out the father's interest in participating in bringing up his own child. That law is plainly valid, but no more so than 3(3) of the Act now before us, resting, as it does, on precisely the same judgment. II Section 3(4) requires that an unmarried woman under 18 years of age obtain the consent of a parent or a person in loco pare ntis as a condition to an abortion. Once again, the Court strikes the provision down in a sentence. It states: \\\"Just as with the requirement of consent from the spouse, so here, the State does not have the constitutional authority to give a third party an absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto over the decision of the physician and his patient to terminate the patient's pregnancy. \\\". Ante at 428 U. S. 74. The Court rejects the notions that the State has an interest in strengthening the family unit, or that the parent has an \\\"independent interest\\\" in the abortion decision, sufficient to justify 3(4), and apparently concludes that the provision is therefore unconstitutional. But the purpose of the parental consent requirement is not merely to vindicate any interest of the parent or of the State. The purpose of the requirement is to vindicate the very right created in Roe v. Wade, supra the right of the pregnant woman to decide Page 428 U. S. 95 \\\"whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. \\\" 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 13 (emphasis added). The abortion decision is unquestionably important, and has irrevocable consequences whichever way it is made. Missouri is entitled to protect the minor unmarried woman from making the decision in a way which is not in her own best interests, and it seeks to achieve this goal by requiring parental consultation and consent. This is the traditional way by which States have sought to protect children from their own immature and improvident decisions, [Footnote 32] and there is absolutely no reason expressed by the majority why the State may not utilize that method here. III Section 9 of the Act prohibits abortion by the method known as saline amniocentesis a method used at the time the Act was passed for 70 of abortions performed after the first trimester. Legislative history reveals that the Missouri Legislature viewed saline amniocentesis as far less safe a method of abortion than the so called prostaglandin method. The court below took evidence on the question and summarized it as follows: \\\"The record of trial discloses that use of the saline method exposes a woman to the danger of severe complications regardless of the skill of the physician or the precaution taken. Saline may cause one or Page 428 U. S. 96 more of he following conditions: disseminated intravascular coagulation or 'consumptive coagulapathy' (disruption of the blood clotting mechanism [D r. Warren, T r. 57-58; D r. Klaus, T r. 269-270; D r. Anderson, T r. 307; D efts. ' Exs. H M]), which may result in severe bleeding and possibly death (D r. Warren, T r. 58); hypernatremia (increase in blood sodium level), which may lead to convulsions and death (D r. Klaus, T r. 268); and water intoxication (accumulated water in the body tissue which may occur when oxy toxin is used in conjunction with the injection of saline), resulting in damage to the central nervous system or death (D r. Warren, T r. 76; D r. Klaus, T r. 270-271; D r. Anderson, T r. 310; D efts. ' Ex. L). There is also evidence that saline amniocentesis causes massive tissue destruction to the inside of the uterus (D r. Anderson, T r. 308). \\\" 392 F. Sup p. 1362, 1372-1373 (1975). The District Court also cited considerable evidence establishing that the prostaglandin method is safer. In fact, the Chief of Obstetrics at Yale University, D r. Anderson, suggested that \\\"physicians should be liable for malpractice if they chose saline over prostaglandin after having been given all the facts on both methods. \\\" Id. at 1373. The Court nevertheless reverses the decision of the District Court sustaining 9 against constitutional challenge. It does so apparently because saline amniocentesis was widely used before the Act was passed; because the prostaglandin method was seldom used, and was not generally available; and because other abortion techniques more dangerous than saline amniocentesis were not banned. At bottom, the majority's holding as well as the concurrence rests on its factual finding that the prostaglandin method is unavailable to the women of Page 428 U. S. 97 Missouri. It therefore concludes that the ban on the saline method is \\\"an unreasonable or arbitrary regulation designed to inhibit, and having the effect of inhibiting, the vast majority of abortions after the first 12 weeks,\\\" ante at 428 U. S. 79. This factual finding was not made either by the majority or by the dissenting judge below. Appellants have not argued that the record below supports such a finding. In fact, the record below does not support such a finding. There is no evidence in the record that women in Missouri will be unable to obtain abortions by the prostaglandin method. What evidence there is in the record on this question supports the contrary conclusion. [Footnote 33] The record discloses that the prostaglandin method of abortion was the country's second most common method of abortion during the second trimester, T r. 42, 89-90; that, although the prostaglandin method had previously been available only on an experimental basis, it was, at the time of trial available in \\\"small hospitals all over the country,\\\" id. at 342; that, in another year or so, the prostaglandin method would become even in the absence of legislation on the subject the most prevalent method. Anderson deposition at 69. Moreover, one doctor quite sensibly testified that, if the saline method were banned, hospitals would quickly switch to the prostaglandin method. The majority relies on the testimony of one doctor that as already noted prostaglandin had been available on an experimental basis only until January 1, 1974, and that its manufacturer, the Upjohn Co. ,restricted its sales to large medical centers for the following six months, after which sales were to be unrestricted. T r. Page 428 U. S. 98 334, 335. In what manner this evidence supports the proposition that prostaglandin is unavailable to the women of Missouri escapes me. The statute involved in this litigation was passed on June 14, 1974; evidence was taken in July, 1974; the District Court's decree sustaining the ban on the saline method which this Court overturns was entered in January, 1975; and this Court declares the statute unconstitutional in July, 1976. There is simply no evidence in the record that prostaglandin was or is unavailable at any time relevant to this case. Without such evidence and without any factual finding by the court below, this Court cannot properly strike down a statute passed by one of the States. Of course, there is no burden on a State to establish the constitutionality of one of its laws. Absent proof of a fact essential to its unconstitutionality, the statute remains in effect. The only other basis for its factual finding which the majority offers is a citation to another case Wolfe v. Schroerin, 388 F. Sup p. 631, 637 (W D Ky. 1974) in which a different court concluded that the record in its case showed the prostaglandin method to be unavailable in another State Kentucky at another time two years ago. This case must be decided on its own record. I am not yet prepared to accept the notion that normal rules of law, procedure, and constitutional adjudication suddenly become irrelevant solely because a case touches on the subject of abortion. The majority's finding of fact that women in Missouri will be unable to obtain abortions after the first trimester if the saline method is banned is wholly unjustifiable. In any event, the point of 9 is to change the practice under which most abortions were performed under the saline amniocentesis method, and to make the safer prostaglandin method generally available. It promises to Page 428 U. S. 99 achieve that result if it remains operative, and the evidence discloses that the result is a desirable one, or at least that the legislature could have so viewed it. That should end our inquiry, unless we purport to be not only the country's continuous constitutional convention but also its ex officio medical board with powers to approve or disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States. IV Section 6(1) of the Act provides: \\\"No person who performs or induces an abortion shall fail to exercise that degree of professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the fetus which such person would be required to exercise in order to preserve the life and health of any fetus intended to be born and not aborted. Any physician or person assisting in the abortion who shall fail to take such measures to encourage or to sustain the life of the child, and the death of the child results, shall be deemed guilty of manslaughter. Further, such physician or other person shall be liable in an action for damages. \\\" If this section is read in any way other than through a microscope, it is plainly intended to require that, where a \\\"fetus [may have] the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb,\\\" Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. at 410 U. S. 163, the abortion be handled in a way which is designed to preserve that life notwithstanding the mother's desire to terminate it. Indeed, even looked at through a microscope, the statute seems to go no further. It requires a physician to exercise \\\"that degree of professional skill to preserve the fetus\\\" which he would be required to exercise if the mother wanted a live child. Plainly, Page 428 U. S. 100 if the pregnancy is to be terminated at a time when there is no chance of life outside the womb, a physician would not be required to exercise any care or skill to preserve the life of the fetus during abortion, no matter what the mother's desires. The statute would appear then to operate only in the gray area after the fetus might be viable, but while the physician is still able to certify \\\"with reasonable medical certainty that the fetus is not viable. \\\" See 5 of the Act, which flatly prohibits abortions absent such a certification. Since the State has a compelling interest, sufficient to outweigh the mother's desire to kill the fetus, when the \\\"fetus has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb,\\\" Roe v. Wade, supra, at 410 U. S. 163, the statute is constitutional. Incredibly, the Court reads the statute instead to require \\\"the physician to preserve the life and health of the fetus, whatever the stage of pregnancy,\\\" ante at 428 U. S. 83, thereby attributing to the Missouri Legislature the strange intention of passing a statute with absolutely no chance of surviving constitutional challenge under Roe v. Wade, supra. The Court compounds its error by also striking down as unseverable the wholly unobjectionable requirement in the second sentence of 6(1) that, where an abortion produces a live child, steps must be taken to sustain its life. It explains its result in two sentences: \\\"We conclude, as did the District Court, that 6(1) must stand or fall as a unit. Its provisions are inextricably bound together. \\\" Ante at 428 U. S. 83. The question whether a constitutional provision of state law is severable from an unconstitutional provision is entirely a question of the intent of the state legislature. There is not the slightest reason to suppose that the Missouri Legislature would not require proper care Page 428 U. S. 101 for live babies just because it cannot require physicians performing abortions to take care to preserve the life of fetuses. The Attorney General of Missouri has argued here that the only intent of 6(1) was to require physicians to support a live baby which resulted from an abortion. At worst, 6(1) is ambiguous on both points, and the District Court should be directed to abstain until a construction may be had from the state courts. Under no circumstances should 6(1) be declared unconstitutional at this point. [Footnote 34] V I join the judgment and opinion of the Court insofar as it upholds the other portions of the Act against constitutional challenge. [Footnote 31] There are countless situations in which the State prohibits conduct only when it is objected to by a private person most closely affected by it. Thus, a State cannot forbid anyone to enter on private property with the owner's consent, but it may enact and enforce trespass laws against unauthorized entrances. It cannot forbid transfer of property held in tenancy by the entireties, but it may require consent by both husband and wife to such a transfer. These situations plainly do not involve delegations of legislative power to private parties; and neither does the requirement in 3(3) that a woman not deprive her husband of his future child without his consent. [Footnote 32] As MR. JUSTICE STEVENS states in his separate opinion, post at 428 U. S. 102: \\\"The State's interest in the welfare of its young citizens justifies a variety of protective measures. Because he may not foresee the consequences of his decision, a minor may not make an enforceable bargain. He may not lawfully work or travel where he pleases, or even attend exhibitions of constitutionally protected adult motion pictures. Persons below a certain age may not marry without parental consent. Indeed, such consent is essential even when the young woman is already pregnant. \\\" [Footnote 33] The absence of more evidence on the subject in the record seems to be a result of the fact that the claim that the prostaglandin method is unavailable was not part of plaintiffs' litigating strategy below. [Footnote 34] The majority's construction of state law is, of course, not binding on the Missouri courts. If they should disagree with the majority's reading of state law on one or both of the points treated by the majority, the State could validly enforce the relevant parts of the statute at least against all those people not parties to this case. Cf. Dombrowski v. P fister, 380 U. S. 479, 380 U. S. 492 (1965). MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part. With the exception of Parts I VD and IV E, I join the Court's opinion. In Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, the Court held that a woman's right to decide whether to abort a pregnancy is entitled to constitutional protection. That decision, which is now part of our law, answers the question discussed in Part IV E of the Court's opinion, but merely poses the question decided in Part I VD. If two abortion procedures had been equally accessible to Missouri women, in my judgment, the United States Constitution would not prevent the state legislature Page 428 U. S. 102 from outlawing the one it found to be less safe even though its conclusion might not reflect a unanimous consensus of informed medical opinion. However, the record indicates that, when the Missouri statute was enacted, a prohibition of the saline amniocentesis procedure was almost tantamount to a prohibition of any abortion in the State after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Such a prohibition is inconsistent with the essential holding of Roe v. Wade, and therefore cannot stand. In my opinion, however, the parental consent requirement is consistent with the holding in Roe. The State's interest in the welfare of its young citizens justifies a variety of protective measures. Because he may not foresee the consequences of his decision, a minor may not make an enforceable bargain. He may not lawfully work or travel where he pleases, or even attend exhibitions of constitutionally protected adult motion pictures. Persons below a certain age may not marry without parental consent. Indeed, such consent is essential even when the young woman is already pregnant. The State's interest in protecting a young person from harm justifies the imposition of restraints on his or her freedom even though comparable restraints on adults would be constitutionally impermissible. Therefore, the holding in Roe v. Wade that the abortion decision is entitled to constitutional protection merely emphasizes the importance of the decision; it does not lead to the conclusion that the state legislature has no power to enact legislation for the purpose of protecting a young pregnant woman from the consequences of an incorrect decision. The abortion decision is, of course, more important than the decision to attend or to avoid an adult motion picture, or the decision to work long hours in a Page 428 U. S. 103 factory. It is not necessarily any more important than the decision to run away from home or the decision to marry. But even if it is the most important kind of a decision a young person may ever make, that assumption merely enhances the quality of the State's interest in maximizing the probability that the decision be made correctly, and with full understanding of the consequences of either alternative. The Court recognizes that the State may insist that the decision not be made without the benefit of medical advice. But since the most significant consequences of the decision are not medical in character, it would seem to me that the State may, with equal legitimacy, insist that the decision be made only after other appropriate counsel has been had as well. Whatever choice a pregnant young woman makes to marry, to abort, to bear her child out of wedlock the consequences of her decision may have a profound impact on her entire future life. A legislative determination that such a choice will be made more wisely in most cases if the advice and moral support of a parent play a part in the decision making process is surely not irrational. Moreover, it is perfectly clear that the parental consent requirement will necessarily involve a parent in the decisional process. If there is no parental consent requirement, many minors will submit to the abortion procedure without ever informing their parents. An assumption that the parental reaction will be hostile, disparaging, or violent no doubt persuades many children simply to bypass parental counsel which would, in fact, be loving, supportive, and, indeed, for some indispensable. It is unrealistic, in my judgment, to assume that every parent child relationship is either (a) so perfect that communication and accord will take place routinely or Page 428 U. S. 104 (b) so imperfect that the absence of communication reflects the child's correct prediction that the parent will exercise his or her veto arbitrarily to further a selfish interest, rather than the child's interest. A state legislature may conclude that most parents will be primarily interested in the welfare of their children, and further, that the imposition of a parental consent requirement is an appropriate method of giving the parents an opportunity to foster that welfare by helping a pregnant distressed child to make and to implement a correct decision. The State's interest is not dependent on an estimate of the impact the parental consent requirement may have on the total number of abortions that may take place. I assume that parents will sometimes prevent abortions which might better be performed; other parents may advise abortions that should not be performed. Similarly, even doctors are not omniscient; specialists in performing abortions may incorrectly conclude that the immediate advantages of the procedure outweigh the disadvantages which a parent could evaluate in better perspective. In each individual case, factors much more profound than a mere medical judgment may weigh heavily in the scales. The overriding consideration is that the right to make the choice be exercised as wisely as possible. The Court assumes that parental consent is an appropriate requirement if the minor is not capable of understanding the procedure and of appreciating its consequences and those of available alternatives. This assumption is, of course, correct and consistent with the predicate which underlies all state legislation seeking to protect minors from the consequences of decisions they are not yet prepared to make. In all such situations, chronological age has been the basis for imposition of a restraint on the minor's freedom of choice even though Page 428 U. S. 105 it is perfectly obvious that such a yardstick is imprecise, and perhaps even unjust in particular cases. The Court seems to assume that the capacity to conceive a child and the judgment of the physician are the only constitutionally permissible yardsticks for determining whether a young woman can independently make the abortion decision. I doubt the accuracy of the Court's empirical judgment. Even if it were correct, however, as a matter of constitutional law I think a State has power to conclude otherwise, and to select a chronological age as its standard. In short, the State's interest in the welfare of its young citizens is sufficient, in my judgment, to support the parental consent requirement.\",\n          \"U. S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973) Roe v. Wade No. 70-18Argued December 13, 1971 Re argued October 11, 1972 Decided January 22, 1973 410 U. S. 113 MR. JUSTICE BLACK MUN delivered the opinion of the Court. This Texas federal appeal and its Georgia companion, Doe v. Bolt on, post, p. 179, present constitutional challenges to state criminal abortion legislation. The Texas statutes under attack here are typical of those that have been in effect in many States for approximately a century. The Georgia statutes, in contrast, have a modern cast, and are a legislative product that, to an extent at least, obviously reflects the influences of recent attitudinal change, of advancing medical knowledge and techniques, and of new thinking about an old issue. We forthwith acknowledge our awareness of the sensitive and emotional nature of the abortion controversy, of the vigorous opposing views, even among physicians, and of the deep and seemingly absolute convictions that the subject inspires. One's philosophy, one's experiences, one's exposure to the raw edges of human existence, one's religious training, one's attitudes toward life and family and their values, and the moral standards one establishes and seeks to observe, are all likely to influence and to color one's thinking and conclusions about abortion. In addition, population growth, pollution, poverty, and racial overtones tend to complicate and not to simplify the problem. Our task, of course, is to resolve the issue by constitutional measurement, free of emotion and of predilection. We seek earnestly to do this, and, because we do, we [117] have inquired into, and in this opinion place some emphasis upon, medical and medical legal history and what that history reveals about man's attitudes toward the abortion procedure over the centuries. We bear in mind, too, Mr. Justice Holmes' admonition in his now vindicated dissent in Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 76 (1905): \\\"[The Constitution] is made for people of fundamentally differing views, and the accident of our finding certain opinions natural and familiar or novel and even shocking ought not to conclude our judgment upon the question whether statutes embodying them conflict with the Constitution of the United States. \\\" I The Texas statutes that concern us here are Arts. 1191-1194 and 1196 of the State's Penal Code. [Footnote 1] These make it a crime to \\\"procure an abortion,\\\" as therein [118] defined, or to attempt one, except with respect to \\\"an abortion procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother. \\\" Similar statutes are in existence in a majority of the States. [Footnote 2] [119] Texas first enacted a criminal abortion statute in 1854. Texas Laws 1854, c. 49, 1, set forth in 3 H. Gam mel, Laws of Texas 1502 (1898). This was soon modified into language that has remained substantially unchanged to the present time. See Texas Penal Code of 1857, c. 7, Arts. 531-536; G. Paschal, Laws of Texas, Arts. 2192-2197 (1866); Texas Rev. S tat. ,c. 8, Arts. 536-541(1879); Texas Rev. C rim. S tat. ,Arts. 1071-1076 (1911). The final article in each of these compilations provided the same exception, as does the present Article 1196, for an abortion by \\\"medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother. \\\" [Footnote 3] [120] II Jane Roe, [Footnote 4] a single woman who was residing in Dallas County, Texas, instituted this federal action in March 1970 against the District Attorney of the county. She sought a declaratory judgment that the Texas criminal abortion statutes were unconstitutional on their face, and an injunction restraining the defendant from enforcing the statutes. Roe alleged that she was unmarried and pregnant; that she wished to terminate her pregnancy by an abortion \\\"performed by a competent, licensed physician, under safe, clinical conditions\\\"; that she was unable to get a \\\"legal\\\" abortion in Texas because her life did not appear to be threatened by the continuation of her pregnancy; and that she could not afford to travel to another jurisdiction in order to secure a legal abortion under safe conditions. She claimed that the Texas statutes were unconstitutionally vague and that they abridged her right of personal privacy, protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. By an amendment to her complaint, Roe purported to sue \\\"on behalf of herself and all other women\\\" similarly situated. James Hub ert Hall ford, a licensed physician, sought and was granted leave to intervene in Roe's action. In his complaint, he alleged that he had been arrested previously for violations of the Texas abortion statutes, and [121] that two such prosecutions were pending against him. He described conditions of patients who came to him seeking abortions, and he claimed that for many cases he, as a physician, was unable to determine whether they fell within or outside the exception recognized by Article 1196. He alleged that, as a consequence, the statutes were vague and uncertain, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that they violated his own and his patients' rights to privacy in the doctor patient relationship and his own right to practice medicine, rights he claimed were guaranteed by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. John and Mary Doe, [Footnote 5] a married couple, filed a companion complaint to that of Roe. They also named the District Attorney as defendant, claimed like constitutional deprivations, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The Does alleged that they were a childless couple; that Mrs. Doe was suffering from a \\\"neuralchemical\\\"disorder; that her physician had \\\"advised her to avoid pregnancy until such time as her condition has materially improved\\\" (although a pregnancy at the present time would not present \\\"a serious risk\\\" to her life); that, pursuant to medical advice, she had discontinued use of birth control pills; and that, if she should become pregnant, she would want to terminate the pregnancy by an abortion performed by a competent, licensed physician under safe, clinical conditions. By an amendment to their complaint, the Does purported to sue \\\"on behalf of themselves and all couples similarly situated. \\\" The two actions were consolidated and heard together by a duly convened three judge district court. The suits thus presented the situations of the pregnant single woman, the childless couple, with the wife not pregnant, [122] and the licensed practicing physician, all joining in the attack on the Texas criminal abortion statutes. Upon the filing of affidavits, motions were made for dismissal and for summary judgment. The court held that Roe and members of her class, and D r. Hall ford, had standing to sue and presented justiciable controversies, but that the Does had failed to allege facts sufficient to state a present controversy, and did not have standing. It concluded that, with respect to the requests for a declaratory judgment, abstention was not warranted. On the merits, the District Court held that the \\\"fundamental right of single women and married persons to choose whether to have children is protected by the Ninth Amendment, through the Fourteenth Amendment,\\\" and that the Texas criminal abortion statutes were void on their face because they were both unconstitutionally vague and constituted an over broad infringement of the plaintiffs' Ninth Amendment rights. The court then held that abstention was warranted with respect to the requests for an injunction. It therefore dismissed the Does' complaint, declared the abortion statutes void, and dismissed the application for injunctive relief. 314 F. Sup p. 1217, 1225 (ND T ex. 1970). The plaintiffs Roe and Doe and the intervenor Hall ford, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. 1253, have appealed to this Court from that part of the District Court's judgment denying the injunction. The defendant District Attorney has purported to crossappeal,pursuant to the same statute, from the court's grant of declaratory relief to Roe and Hall ford. Both sides also have taken protective appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That court ordered the appeals held in abeyance pending decision here. We postponed decision on jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits. 402 U. S. 941 (1971) [123] It might have been preferable if the defendant, pursuant to our Rule 20, had presented to us a petition for certiorari before judgment in the Court of Appeals with respect to the granting of the plaintiffs' prayer for declaratory relief. Our decisions in Mitchell v. Donovan, 398 U. S. 427 (1970), and Gun n v. University Committee, 399 U. S. 383 (1970), are to the effect that 1253 does not authorize an appeal to this Court from the grant or denial of declaratory relief alone. We conclude, nevertheless, that those decisions do not foreclose our review of both the injunctive and the declaratory aspects of a case of this kind when it is properly here, as this one is, on appeal under 1253 from specific denial of injunctive relief, and the arguments as to both aspects are necessarily identical. See Carter v. Jury Comm'n, 396 U. S. 320 (1970); Florida Lime Growers v. Jacob sen, 362 U. S. 73, 80-81(1960). It would be destructive of time and energy for all concerned were we to rule otherwise. Cf. Doe v. Bolt on, post, p. 179. IV We are next confronted with issues of justiciability, standing, and abstention. Have Roe and the Does established that \\\"personal stake in the outcome of the controversy,\\\" Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204 (1962), that insures that \\\"the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution,\\\" F last v. Co hen, 392 U. S. 83, 101 (1968), and Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 732 (1972)? And what effect did the pendency of criminal abortion charges against D r. Hall ford in state court have upon the propriety of the federal court's granting relief to him as aplaintiff-intervenor?[124] A. Jane Roe. Despite the use of the pseudonym, no suggestion is made that Roe is a fictitious person. For purposes of her case, we accept as true, and as established, her existence; her pregnant state, as of the inception of her suit in March 1970 and as late as May 21 of that year when she filed an alias affidavit with the District Court; and her inability to obtain a legal abortion in Texas. Viewing Roe's case as of the time of its filing and thereafter until as late a May, there can be little dispute that it then presented a case or controversy and that, wholly apart from the class aspects, she, as a pregnant single woman thwarted by the Texas criminal abortion laws, had standing to challenge those statutes. Abele v. Mark le, 452 F. 2d 1121, 1125 (CA2 1971); Cros sen v. Brecken ridge, 446 F. 2d 833, 838-839 (CA6 1971); Poe v. Menghini, 339 F. Sup p. 986, 990-991 (Kan. 1972). See Truax v. Ra ich, 239 U. S. 33 (1915). Indeed, we do not read the appellee's brief as really asserting anything to the contrary. The \\\"logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated,\\\" F last v. Co hen, 392 U. S. at 102, and the necessary degree of contentiousness, Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U. S. 103 (1969), are both present. The appellee notes, however, that the record does not disclose that Roe was pregnant at the time of the District Court hearing on May 22, 1970, [Footnote 6] or on the following June 17 when the court's opinion and judgment were filed. And he suggests that Roe's case must now be moot because she and all other members of her class are no longer subject to any 1970 pregnancy. [125] The usual rule Inc., 340 U. S. 36 (1950); Golden v. Zwickler, supra; SEC v. Medical Committee for Human Rights, 404 U. S. 403 (1972). But when, as here, pregnancy is a significant fact in the litigation, the normal 266-day human gestation period is so short that the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is complete. If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied. Our law should not be that rigid. Pregnancy often comes more than once to the same woman, and in the general population, if man is to survive, it will always be with us. Pregnancy provides a classic justification for a conclusion of nonmootness. It truly could be \\\"capable of repetition, yet evading review. \\\" Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S. 498, 515 (1911). See Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U. S. 814, 816 (1969); Carroll v. Princess Anne, 393 U. S. 175, 178-179(1968); United States v. W. T. Grant Co. Co., 345 U. S. 629, 632-633(1953). We, therefore, agree with the District Court that Jane Roe had standing to undertake this litigation, that she presented a justiciable controversy, and that the termination of her 1970 pregnancy has not rendered her case moot. B. D r. Hall ford. The doctor's position is different. He entered Roe's litigation as a plaintiff intervenor, alleging in his complaint that he: \\\"[I]n the past has been arrested for violating the Texas Abortion Laws and at the present time stands charged by indictment with violating said laws in the Criminal District Court of Dallas County, Texas to wit: (1) The State of Texas vs. [126] James H. Hall ford, No. C-69-5307-IH, and (2) The State of Texas vs. James H. Hall ford, No. C-692524-H. In both cases, abortion.... \\\" In his application for leave to intervene, the doctor made like representations as to the abortion charges pending in the state court. These representations were also repeated in the affidavit he executed and filed in support of his motion for summary judgment. D r. Hall ford is, therefore, in the position of seeking, in a federal court, declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the same statutes under which he stands charged in criminal prosecutions simultaneously pending in state court. Although he stated that he has been arrested in the past for violating the State's abortion laws, he makes no allegation of any substantial and immediate threat to any federally protected right that cannot be asserted in his defense against the state prosecutions. Neither is there any allegation of harassment or bad faith prosecution. In order to escape the rule articulated in the cases cited in the next paragraph of this opinion that, absent harassment and bad faith, a defendant in a pending state criminal case cannot affirmatively challenge in federal court the statutes under which the State is prosecuting him, D r. Hall ford seeks to distinguish his status as a present state defendant from his status as a \\\"potential future defendant,\\\" and to assert only the latter for standing purposes here. We see no merit in that distinction. Our decision in Samuels v. Mac kell, 401 U. S. 66 (1971), compels the conclusion that the District Court erred when it granted declaratory relief to D r. Hall ford instead of refraining from so doing. The court, of course, was correct in refusing to grant injunctive relief to the doctor. The reasons supportive of that action, however, are those expressed in Samuels v. Mac kell, supra, and in Younger v. [127] Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971); Boyle v. Lan dry, 401 U. S. 77 (1971); Perez v. Le desma, 401 U. S. 82 (1971); and Byrne v. Karaleis, 401 U. S. 216 (1971). See also Dombrowski v. P fister, 380 U. S. 479 (1965). We note, in passing, that Younger and its companion cases were decided after the three judge District Court decision in this case. D r. Hallford's complaint in intervention, therefore, is to be dismissed. [Footnote 7] He is remitted to his defenses in the state criminal proceedings against him. We reverse the judgment of the District Court insofar as it granted D r. Hall ford relief and failed to dismiss his complaint in intervention. C. The Does. In view of our ruling as to Roe's standing in her case, the issue of the Does' standing in their case has little significance. The claims they assert are essentially the same as those of Roe, and they attack the same statutes. Nevertheless, we briefly note the Does' posture. Their pleadings present them as a childless married couple, the woman not being pregnant, who have no desire to have children at this time because of their having received medical advice that Mrs. Doe should avoid pregnancy, and for \\\"other highly personal reasons. \\\" But they \\\"fear ..they may face the prospect of becoming [128] parents. \\\" And if pregnancy ensues, they \\\"would want to terminate\\\" it by an abortion. They assert an inability to obtain an abortion legally in Texas and, consequently, the prospect of obtaining an illegal abortion there or of going outside Texas to some place where the procedure could be obtained legally and competently. We thus have as plaintiffs a married couple who have, as their asserted immediate and present injury, only an alleged \\\"detrimental effect upon [their] marital happiness\\\" because they are forced to \\\"the choice of refraining from normal sexual relations or of endangering Mary Doe's health through a possible pregnancy. \\\" Their claim is that, sometime in the future, Mrs. Doe might become pregnant because of possible failure of contraceptive measures, and, at that time in the future, she might want an abortion that might then be illegal under the Texas statutes. This very phrasing of the Does' position reveals its speculative character. Their alleged injury rests on possible future contraceptive failure, possible future pregnancy, possible future unpreparedness for parenthood, and possible future impairment of health. Any one or more of these several possibilities may not take place, and all may not combine. In the Does' estimation, these possibilities might have some real or imagined impact upon their marital happiness. But we are not prepared to say that the bare allegation of so indirect an injury is sufficient to present an actual case or controversy. Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. at41-42; Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U. S. at 109-110; Abele v. Mark le, 452 F. 2d at 1124-1125; Cros sen v. Brecken ridge, 446 F. 2d at 839. The Does' claim falls far short of those resolved otherwise in the cases that the Does urge upon us, namely, Investment Co. Institute v. Camp, 401 U. S. 617 (1971); Data Processing Service v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150 (1970); [129] and Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97 (1968). See also Truax v. Ra ich, 239 U. S. 33 (1915). The Does therefore are not appropriate plaintiffs in this litigation. Their complaint was properly dismissed by the District Court, and we affirm that dismissal. V The principal thrust of appellant's attack on the Texas statutes is that they improperly invade a right, said to be possessed by the pregnant woman, to choose to terminate her pregnancy. Appellant would discover this right in the concept of personal \\\"liberty\\\" embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause; or in personal, marital, familial, and sexual privacy said to be protected by the Bill of Rights or its penumbras, see Gris wold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972); id. at 460 (WHITE, J. ,concurring in result); or among those rights reserved to the people by the Ninth Amendment, Gris wold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. at 486 (Goldberg, J. ,concurring). Before addressing this claim, we feel it desirable briefly to survey, in several aspects, the history of abortion, for such insight as that history may afford us, and then to examine the state purposes and interests behind the criminal abortion laws. VI It perhaps is not generally appreciated that the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage. Those laws, generally proscribing abortion or its attempt at any time during pregnancy except when necessary to preserve the pregnant woman's life, are not of ancient or even of common law origin. Instead, they derive from statutory changes effected, for the most part, in the latter half of the 19th century. [130] 1. Ancient attitudes. These are not capable of precise determination. We are told that, at the time of the Persian Empire, abortifacients were known, and that criminal abortions were severely punished. [Footnote 8] We are also told, however, that abortion was practiced in Greek times as well as in the Roman Era, [Footnote 9] and that \\\"it was resorted to without scruple. \\\" [Footnote 10] The Ephesian, Sora nos, often described as the greatest of the ancient gynecologists, appears to have been generally opposed to Rome's prevailing free abortion practices. He found it necessary to think first of the life of the mother, and he resorted to abortion when, upon this standard, he felt the procedure advisable. [Footnote 11] Greek and Roman law afforded little protection to the unborn. If abortion was prosecuted in some places, it seems to have been based on a concept of a violation of the father's right to his offspring. Ancient religion did not bar abortion. [Footnote 12] 2. The Hippocratic Oath. What then of the famous Oath that has stood so long as the ethical guide of the medical profession and that bears the name of the great Greek(460(?)-377(?) B. C. ),who has been described [131] as the Father of Medicine, the \\\"wisest and the greatest practitioner of his art,\\\" and the \\\"most important and most complete medical personality of antiquity,\\\" who dominated the medical schools of his time, and who typified the sum of the medical knowledge of the past? [Footnote 13] The Oath varies somewhat according to the particular translation, but in any translation the content is clear: \\\"I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and in like manner, I will not give to a woman a pessary to produce abortion, [Footnote 14]\\\" or \\\"I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly, I will not give to a woman an abortive remedy. [Footnote 15]\\\" Although the Oath is not mentioned in any of the principal briefs in this case or in Doe v. Bolt on, post, p. 179, it represents the apex of the development of strict ethical concepts in medicine, and its influence endures to this day. Why did not the authority of Hippocrates dissuade abortion practice in his time and that of Rome? The late D r. Edelstein provides us with a theory: [Footnote 16] The Oath was not uncontested even in Hippocrates' day; only the Pythagorean school of philosophers frowned upon the related act of suicide. Most Greek thinkers, on the other hand, commended abortion, at least prior to viability. See Plato, Republic, V, 461; Aristotle, Politics, VII, 1335b 25. For the Pythagorean s, however, it was a matter of dogma. For them, the embryo was animate from the moment of conception, and abortion meant destruction of a living being. The abortion clause of the Oath, therefore, \\\"echoes Pythagorean doctrines,\\\" [132] and \\\"[i]n no other stratum of Greek opinion were such views held or proposed in the same spirit of uncompromising austerity. \\\" [Footnote 17] D r. Edelstein then concludes that the Oath originated in a group representing only a small segment of Greek opinion, and that it certainly was not accepted by all ancient physicians. He points out that medical writings down to Galen (A. D. 130-200) \\\"give evidence of the violation of almost every one of its injunctions. \\\" [Footnote 18] But with the end of antiquity, a decided change took place. Resistance against suicide and against abortion became common. The Oath came to be popular. The emerging teachings of Christianity were in agreement with the Pythagorean ethic. The Oath \\\"became the nucleus of all medical ethics,\\\" and \\\"was applauded as the embodiment of truth. \\\" Thus, suggests D r. Edelstein, it is \\\"a Pythagorean manifesto, and not the expression of an absolute standard of medical conduct. \\\" [Footnote 19] This, it seems to us, is a satisfactory and acceptable explanation of the Hippocratic Oath's apparent rigidity. It enables us to understand, in historical context, a long accepted and revered statement of medical ethics. 3. The common law. It is undisputed that, at common law, abortion performed before \\\"quickening\\\" the first recognizable movement of the fetus in ute ro, appearing usually from the 16th to the 18th week of pregnancy [Footnote 20] was not an indictable offense. [Footnote 21] The absence [133] of a common law crime for prequickening abortion appears to have developed from a confluence of earlier philosophical, theological, and civil and canon law concepts of when life begins. These disciplines variously approached the question in terms of the point at which the embryo or fetus became \\\"formed\\\" or recognizably human, or in terms of when a \\\"person\\\" came into being, that is, infused with a \\\"soul\\\" or \\\"animated. \\\" A loose consensus evolved in early English law that these events occurred at some point between conception and live birth. [Footnote 22] This was \\\"mediate animation. \\\" Although [134] Christian theology and the canon law came to fix the point of animation at 40 days for a male and 80 days for a female, a view that persisted until the 19th century, there was otherwise little agreement about the precise time of formation or animation. There was agreement, however, that, prior to this point, the fetus was to be regarded as part of the mother, and its destruction, therefore, was not homicide. Due to continued uncertainty about the precise time when animation occurred, to the lack of any empirical basis for the 40-80-day view, and perhaps to Aquinas' definition of movement as one of the two first principles of life, Br acton focused upon quickening as the critical point. The significance of quickening was echoed by later common law scholars, and found its way into the received common law in this country. Whether abortion of a quick fetus was a felony at common law, or even a lesser crime, is still disputed. Br acton, writing early in the 13th century, thought it homicide. [Footnote 23] But the later and predominant view, following the great common law scholars, has been that it was, at most, a lesser offense. In a frequently cited [135] passage, Coke took the position that abortion of a woman \\\"quick with childe\\\" is \\\"a great misprision, and no murder. \\\" [Footnote 24] Black stone followed, saying that, while abortion after quickening had once been considered manslaughter (though not murder), \\\"modern law\\\" took a less severe view. [Footnote 25] A recent review of the common law precedents argues, however, that those precedents contradict Coke, and that even post quickening abortion was never established as a common law crime. [Footnote 26] This is of some importance, because, while most American courts ruled, in holding or dictum, that abortion of an unquickened fetus was not criminal under their received common law, [Footnote 27] other s followed Coke in stating that abortion [136] of a quick fetus was a \\\"misprision,\\\" a term they translated to mean \\\"misdemeanor. \\\" [Footnote 28] That their reliance on Coke on this aspect of the law was uncritical and, apparently in all the reported cases, dictum (due probably to the paucity of common law prosecutions forpostquickening abortion), makes it now appear doubtful that abortion was ever firmly established as a common law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus. 4. The English statutory law. England's first criminal abortion statute, Lord Ellenborough's Act, 43 Geo. 3, c. 58, came in 1803. It made abortion of a quick fetus, 1, a capital crime, but, in 2, it provided lesser penalties for the felony of abortion before quickening, and thus preserved the \\\"quickening\\\" distinction. This contrast was continued in the general revision of 1828, 9 Geo. 4, c. 31, 13. It disappeared, however, together with the death penalty, in 1837, 7 Will. 4 1 Vi ct. ,c. 85. 6, and did not reappear in the Offenses Against the Person Act of 1861, 24 25 Vi ct. ,c. 100, 59, that formed the core of Englishantiabortion law until the liberalizing reforms of 1967. In 1929, the Infant Life (Preservation) Act, 19 20 Geo. 5, c. 34, came into being. Its emphasis was upon the destruction of \\\"the life of a child capable of being born alive. \\\" It made a willful act performed with the necessary intent a felony. It contained a proviso that one was not to be [137] found guilty of the offense \\\"unless it is proved that the act which caused the death of the child was not done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother. \\\" A seemingly notable development in the English law was the case of Rex v. Bourne, [1939] 1 K. B. 687. This case apparently answered in the affirmative the question whether an abortion necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman was excepted from the criminal penalties of the 1861 Act. In his instructions to the jury, Judge Macnaghten referred to the 1929 Act, and observed that that Act related to \\\"the case where a child is killed by a willful act at the time when it is being delivered in the ordinary course of nature. \\\" Id. at 691. He concluded that the 1861 Act's use of the word \\\"unlawfully,\\\" imported the same meaning expressed by the specific proviso in the 1929 Act, even though there was no mention of preserving the mother's life in the 1861 Act. He then construed the phrase \\\"preserving the life of the mother\\\" broadly, that is, \\\"in a reasonable sense,\\\" to include a serious and permanent threat to the mother's health, and instructed the jury to acquit D r. Bourne if it found he had acted in a good faith belief that the abortion was necessary for this purpose. Id. at 693-694. The jury did acquit. Recently, Parliament enacted a new abortion law. This is the Abortion Act of 1967, 15 16 Eliz. 2, c. 87. The Act permits a licensed physician to perform an abortion where two other licensed physicians agree (a) \\\"that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, or of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated,\\\" or (b) \\\"that there is a substantial risk that, if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as [138] to be seriously handicapped. \\\" The Act also provides that, in making this determination, \\\"account may be taken of the pregnant woman's actual or reasonably foreseeable environment. \\\" It also permits a physician, without the concurrence of other s, to terminate a pregnancy where he is of the good faith opinion that the abortion \\\"is immediately necessary to save the life or to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman. \\\" 5. The American law. In this country, the law in effect in all but a few States until mid-19th century was the preexisting English common law. Connecticut, the first State to enact abortion legislation, adopted in 1821 that part of Lord Ellenborough's Act that related to a woman \\\"quick with child. \\\" [Footnote 29] The death penalty was not imposed. Abortion before quickening was made a crime in that State only in 1860. [Footnote 30] In 1828, New York enacted legislation [Footnote 31] that, in two respects, was to serve as a model for early anti abortion statutes. First, while barring destruction of an unquickened fetus as well as a quick fetus, it made the former only a misdemeanor, but the latter seconddegreemanslaughter. Second, it incorporated a concept of therapeutic abortion by providing that an abortion was excused if it \\\"shall have been necessary to preserve the life of such mother, or shall have been advised by two physicians to be necessary for such purpose. \\\" By 1840, when Texas had received the common law, [Footnote 32] only eight American States [139] had statutes dealing with abortion. [Footnote 33] It was not until after the War Between the States that legislation began generally to replace the common law. Most of these initial statutes dealt severely with abortion after quickening, but were lenient with it before quickening. Most punished attempts equally with completed abortions. While many statutes included the exception for an abortion thought by one or more physicians to be necessary to save the mother's life, that provision soon disappeared, and the typical law required that the procedure actually be necessary for that purpose. Gradually, in the middle and late 19th century, the quickening distinction disappeared from the statutory law of most States and the degree of the offense and the penalties were increased. By the end of the 1950's, a large majority of the jurisdictions banned abortion, however and whenever performed, unless done to save or preserve the life of the mother. [Footnote 34] The exceptions, Alabama and the District of Columbia, permitted abortion to preserve the mother's health. [Footnote 35] Three States permitted abortions that were not \\\"unlawfully\\\" performed or that were not \\\"without lawful justification,\\\" leaving interpretation of those standards to the courts. [Footnote 36] In [140] the past several years, however, a trend toward liberalization of abortion statutes has resulted in adoption, by about onethirdof the States, of less stringent laws, most of them patterned after the ALI Model Penal Code, 230. 3, [Footnote 37] set forth as Appendix B to the opinion in Doe v. Bolt on, post, p. 205. It is thus apparent that, at common law, at the time of the adoption of our Constitution, and throughout the major portion of the 19th century, abortion was viewed with less disfavor than under most American statutes currently in effect. Phrasing it another way, a woman enjoyed a substantially broader right to terminate a pregnancy than she does in most States today. At least with respect to the early stage of pregnancy, and very possibly without such a limitation, the opportunity [141] to make this choice was present in this country well into the 19th century. Even later, the law continued for some time to treat less punitively an abortion procured in early pregnancy. 6. The position of the American Medical Association. The anti abortion mood prevalent in this country in the late 19th century was shared by the medical profession. Indeed, the attitude of the profession may have played a significant role in the enactment of stringent criminal abortion legislation during that period. An AMA Committee on Criminal Abortion was appointed in May, 1857. It presented its report, 12 Tra ns. of the Am. Med. As sn. 778 (1859), to the Twelfth Annual Meeting. That report observed that the Committee had been appointed to investigate criminal abortion \\\"with a view to its general suppression. \\\" It deplored abortion and its frequency and it listed three causes of \\\"this general demoralization\\\": \\\"The first of these causes is a widespread popular ignorance of the true character of the crime a belief, even among mothers life.... \\\" \\\"The third reason of the frightful extent of this crime is found in the grave defects of our laws, both common and statute, as regards the independent and actual existence of the child before birth, as a living being. These errors, which are sufficient in most instances to prevent conviction, are based, and only based, upon mistaken and exploded medical dogmas. With strange inconsistency, the law fully acknowledges the foetus in ute ro and its inherent rights, for civil purposes; while personally and as criminally affected, it fails to recognize it, [142] and to its life as yet denies all protection. \\\" Id. at 776. The Committee then offered, and the Association adopted, resolutions protesting \\\"against such unwarrantable destruction of human life,\\\" calling upon state legislatures to revise their abortion laws, and requesting the cooperation of state medical societies \\\"in pressing the subject. \\\" Id. at 28, 78. In 1871, a long and vivid report was submitted by the Committee on Criminal Abortion. It ended with the observation, \\\"We had to deal with human life. In a matter of less importance, we could entertain no compromise. An honest judge on the bench would call things by their proper names. We could do no less. \\\" 22 Tra ns. of the Am. Med. As sn. 268 (1871). It proffered resolutions, adopted by the Association, id. at 38-39,recommending, among other things, that it \\\"be unlawful and unprofessional for any physician to induce abortion or premature labor without the concurrent opinion of at least one respectable consulting physician, and then always with a view to the safety of the child if that be possible,\\\" and calling \\\"the attention of the clergy of all denominations to the perverted views of morality entertained by a large class of females aye, and men also, on this important question. \\\" Except for periodic condemnation of the criminal abortionist, no further formal AMA action took place until 1967. In that year, the Committee on Human Reproduction urged the adoption of a stated policy of opposition to induced abortion except when there is \\\"documented medical evidence\\\" of a threat to the health or life of the mother, or that the child \\\"may be born with incapacitating physical deformity or mental deficiency,\\\" or that a pregnancy \\\"resulting from legally established statutory or forcible rape or incest may constitute a threat to the mental or physical health of the [143] patient,\\\" two other physicians \\\"chosen because of their recognized professional competence have examined the patient and have concurred in writing,\\\" and the procedure \\\"is performed in a hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. \\\" The providing of medical information by physicians to state legislatures in their consideration of legislation regarding therapeutic abortion was \\\"to be considered consistent with the principles of ethics of the American Medical Association. \\\" This recommendation was adopted by the House of Delegates. Proceedings of the AMA House of Delegates 40-51 (June 1967). In 1970, after the introduction of a variety of proposed resolutions and of a report from its Board of Trustees, a reference committee noted \\\"polarization of the medical profession on this controversial issue\\\"; division among those who had testified; a difference of opinion among AMA councils and. committees; \\\"the remarkable shift in testimony\\\" in six months, felt to be influenced \\\"by the rapid changes in state laws and by the judicial decisions which tend to make abortion more freely available; \\\" and a feeling \\\"that this trend will continue. \\\" On June 25, 1970, the House of Delegates adopted preambles and most of the resolutions proposed by the reference committee. The preambles emphasized \\\"the best interests of the patient,\\\" \\\"sound clinical judgment,\\\" and \\\"informed patient consent,\\\" in contrast to \\\"mere acquiescence to the patient's demand. \\\" The resolutions asserted that abortion is a medical procedure that should be performed by a licensed physician in an accredited hospital only after consultation with two other physicians and in conformity with state law, and that no party to the procedure should be required to violate personally held moral principles. [Footnote 38] Proceedings [144] of the AMA House of Delegates 220 (June 1970). The AMA Judicial Council rendered a complementary opinion. [Footnote 39] 7. The position of the American Public Health Association. In October, 1970, the Executive Board of the APHA adopted Standards for Abortion Services. These were five in number: \\\"a. Rapid and simple abortion referral must be readily available through state and local public [145] health departments, medical societies, or other nonprofit organizations. \\\" \\\"b. An important function of counseling should be to simplify and expedite the provision of abortion services; it should not delay the obtaining of these services. \\\" \\\"c. Psychiatric consultation should not be mandatory. As in the case of other specialized medical services, psychiatric consultation should be sought for definite indications, and not on a routine basis. \\\" \\\"d. A wide range of individuals from appropriately trained, sympathetic volunteers to highly skilled physicians may qualify as abortion counselors. \\\" \\\"e. Contraception an dor sterilization should be discussed with each abortion patient. \\\" \\\"Recommended Standards for Abortion Services, 61 Am. J. Pub. Health 396 (1971). Among factors pertinent to life and health risks associated with abortion were three that 'are recognized as important': \\\" \\\"a. the skill of the physician,\\\" \\\"b. the environment in which the abortion is performed, and above all\\\" \\\"c. the duration of pregnancy, as determined by uterine size and confirmed by menstrual history. \\\" Id. at 397. It was said that \\\"a well equipped hospital\\\" offers more protection \\\"to cope with unforeseen difficulties than an office or clinic without such resources. ...The factor of gestational age is of overriding importance. \\\" Thus, it was recommended that abortions in the second trimester and early abortions in the presence of existing medical complications be performed in hospitals as inpatient procedures. For pregnancies in the first trimester, [146] abortion in the hospital with or without overnight stay \\\"is probably the safest practice. \\\" An abortion in an extramural facility, however, is an acceptable alternative \\\"provided arrangements exist in advance to admit patients promptly if unforeseen complications develop. \\\" Standards for an abortion facility were listed. It was said that, at present, abortions should be performed by physicians or osteopaths who are licensed to practice and who have \\\"adequate training. \\\" Id. at 398. 8. The position of the American Bar Association. At its meeting in February, 1972, the ABA House of Delegates approved, with 17 opposing votes, the Uniform Abortion Act that had been drafted and approved the preceding August by the Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. 58 A. B. A. J. 380 (1972). We set forth the Act in full in the margin. [Footnote 40] The [147] Opinion of the Court Conference has appended an enlightening Prefatory Note. [Footnote 41] VII Three reasons have been advanced to explain historically the enactment of criminal abortion laws in the 19th century and to justify their continued existence. [148] It has been argued occasionally that these laws were the product of a Victorian social concern to discourage illicit sexual conduct. Texas, however, does not advance this justification in the present case, and it appears that no court or commentator has taken the argument seriously. [Footnote 42] The appellants and ami ci contend, moreover, that this is not a proper state purpose, at all and suggest that, if it were, the Texas statutes are over broad in protecting it, since the law fails to distinguish between married and unwed mothers. A second reason is concerned with abortion as a medical procedure. When most criminal abortion laws were first enacted, the procedure was a hazardous one for the woman. [Footnote 43] This was particularly true prior to the [149] development of antisepsis. Antiseptic techniques, of course, were based on discoveries by Lister, Pasteur, and other s first announced in 1867, but were not generally accepted and employed until about the turn of the century. Abortion mortality was high. Even after 1900, and perhaps until as late as the development of antibiotics in the 1940's, standard modern techniques such as dilation and curettage were not nearly so safe as they are today. Thus, it has been argued that a State's real concern in enacting a criminal abortion law was to protect the pregnant woman, that is, to restrain her from submitting to a procedure that placed her life in serious jeopardy. Modern medical techniques have altered this situation. Appellants and various ami ci refer to medical data indicating that abortion in early pregnancy, that is, prior to the end of the first trimester, although not without its risk, is now relatively safe. Mortality rates for women undergoing early abortions, where the procedure is legal, appear to be as low as or lower than the rates for normal childbirth. [Footnote 44] Consequently, any interest of the State in protecting the woman from an inherently hazardous procedure, except when it would be equally dangerous for her to forgo it, has largely disappeared. Of course, important state interests in the areas of health and medical standards do remain. [150] The State has a legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion, like any other medical procedure, is performed under circumstances that insure maximum safety for the patient. This interest obviously extends at least to the performing physician and his staff, to the facilities involved, to the availability of aftercare, and to adequate provision for any complication or emergency that might arise. The prevalence of high mortality rates at illegal \\\"abortion mills\\\" strengthens, rather than weakens, the State's interest in regulating the conditions under which abortions are performed. Moreover, the risk to the woman increases as her pregnancy continues. Thus, the State retains a definite interest in protecting the woman's own health and safety when an abortion is proposed at a late stage of pregnancy. The third reason is the State's interest some phrase it in terms of duty in protecting prenatal life. Some of the argument for this justification rests on the theory that a new human life is present from the moment of conception. [Footnote 45] The State's interest and general obligation to protect life then extends, it is argued, to prenatal life. Only when the life of the pregnant mother herself is at stake, balanced against the life she carries within her, should the interest of the embryo or fetus not prevail. Logically, of course, a legitimate state interest in this area need not stand or fall on acceptance of the belief that life begins at conception or at some other point prior to live birth. In assessing the State's interest, recognition may be given to the less rigid claim that as long as at least potential life is involved, the State may assert interests beyond the protection of the pregnant woman alone. [151] Parties challenging state abortion laws have sharply disputed in some courts the contention that a purpose of these laws, when enacted, was to protect prenatal life. [Footnote 46] Pointing to the absence of legislative history to support the contention, they claim that most state laws were designed solely to protect the woman. Because medical advances have lessened this concern, at least with respect to abortion in early pregnancy, they argue that with respect to such abortions the laws can no longer be justified by any state interest. There is some scholarly support for this view of original purpose. [Footnote 47] The few state courts called upon to interpret their laws in the late 19th and early 20th centuries did focus on the State's interest in protecting the woman's health, rather than in preserving the embryo and fetus. [Footnote 48] Proponents of this view point out that in many States, including Texas, [Footnote 49] by statute or judicial interpretation, the pregnant woman herself could not be prosecuted for self abortion or for cooperating in an abortion performed upon her by another. [Footnote 50] They claim that adoption of the \\\"quickening\\\" distinction through received common [152] law and state statutes tacitly recognizes the greater health hazards inherent in late abortion and impliedly repudiates the theory that life begins at conception. It is with these interests, and the eight to be attached to them, that this case is concerned. VIII The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, going back perhaps as far as Union Pacific R. Co. v. Bots ford, 141 U. S. 250, 251 (1891), the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution. In varying contexts, the Court or individual Justices have, indeed, found at least the roots of that right in the First Amendment, Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557, 564 (1969); in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 8-9(1968), Kat z v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 350 (1967), Boy d v. United States, 116 U. S. 616 (1886), see Olm stead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J. ,dissenting); in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights, Gris wold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. at 484-485; in the Ninth Amendment, id. at 486 (Goldberg, J. ,concurring); or in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, see M eyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399 (1923). These decisions make it clear that only personal rights that can be deemed \\\"fundamental\\\" or \\\"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\\\" Pal ko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325 (1937), are included in this guarantee of personal privacy. They also make it clear that the right has some extension to activities relating to marriage, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 12 (1967); procreation, Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U. S. 535, 541-542(1942); contraception, Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. at453-454; id. at 460, 463-465[153] (WHITE, J. ,concurring in result); family relationships, Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 166 (1944); and child rearing and education, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 535 (1925), M eyer v. Nebraska, supra. This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent. Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it. In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation. On the basis of elements such as these, appellant and some ami ci argue that the woman's right is absolute and that she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way, and for whatever reason she alone chooses. With this we do not agree. Appellant's arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all in regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman's sole determination, are unpersuasive. The [154] Court's decisions recognizing a right of privacy also acknowledge that some state regulation in areas protected by that right is appropriate. As noted above, a State may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life. At some point in pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision. The privacy right involved, therefore, cannot be said to be absolute. In fact, it is not clear to us that the claim asserted by some ami ci that one has an unlimited right to do with one's body as one pleases bears a close relationship to the right of privacy previously articulated in the Court's decisions. The Court has refused to recognize an unlimited right of this kind in the past. Jacob son v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11 (1905) (vaccination); Buck v. Bell, 274 U. S. 200 (1927) (sterilization). We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified, and must be considered against important state interests in regulation. We note that those federal and state courts that have recently considered abortion law challenges have reached the same conclusion. A majority, in addition to the District Court in the present case, have held state laws unconstitutional, at least in part, because of vagueness or because of over breadth and abridgment of rights. Abele v. Mark le, 342 F. Sup p. 800 (Conn. 1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-56;Abele v. Mark le, 351 F. Sup p. 224 (Conn. 1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-730;Doe v. Bolt on, 319 F.

Attorney General, 344 F. Sup p. 587 (ED Ky. 1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-256;Rosen v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, 318 F. Sup p. 1217 (ED La. 1970), appeal docketed, No. 70-42;Corkey v. Edwards, 322 F. Sup p. 1248 (WDNC 1971), appeal docketed, No. 71-92;Steinberg v. Brown, 321 F. Sup p. 741 (ND Ohio 1970); Doe v. Ramp ton (Utah 1971), appeal docketed, No. 71-5666; Cheaney v. State, I nd. , 285 N. E. 2d 265 (1972); Spears v. State, 257 So. 2d 876 (Miss. 1972); State v. M unson, 86 S. D. 663, 201 N. W. 2d 123 (1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-631. Although the results are divided, most of these courts have agreed that the right of privacy, however based, is broad enough to cover the abortion decision; that the right, nonetheless, is not absolute, and is subject to some limitations; and that, at some point, the state interests as to protection of health, medical standards, and prenatal life, become dominant. We agree with this approach. Where certain \\\"fundamental rights\\\" are involved, the Court has held that regulation limiting these rights may be justified only by a \\\"compelling state interest,\\\" Kra mer v. Union Free School District, 395 U. S. 621, 627 (1969); Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, 634 (1969), Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 406 (1963), and that legislative enactments must be narrowly drawn to express only the legitimate state interests at stake. Gris wold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. at 485; Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500, 508 (1964); Cant well v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 307-308(1940); see [156] Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. at 460, 463-464 (WHITE, J. ,concurring in result). In the recent abortion cases cited above, courts have recognized these principles. Those striking down state laws have generally scrutinized the State's interests in protecting health and potential life, and have concluded that neither interest justified broad limitations on the reasons for which a physician and his pregnant patient might decide that she should have an abortion in the early stages of pregnancy. Courts sustaining state laws have held that the State's determinations to protect health or prenatal life are dominant and constitutionally justifiable. IX The District Court held that the appellee failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the Texas statute's infringement upon Roe's rights was necessary to support a compelling state interest, and that, although the appellee presented \\\"several compelling justifications for state presence in the area of abortions,\\\" the statutes outstripped these justifications and swept \\\"far beyond any areas of compelling state interest. \\\" 314 F. Sup p. at 1222-1223. Appellant and appellee both contest that holding. Appellant, as has been indicated, claims an absolute right that bars any state imposition of criminal penalties in the area. Appellee argues that the State's determination to recognize and protect prenatal life from and after conception constitutes a compelling state interest. As noted above, we do not agree fully with either formulation. A. The appellee and certain ami ci argue that the fetus is a \\\"person\\\" within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well known facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, [157] for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment. The appellant conceded as much on reargument. [Footnote 51] On the other hand, the appellee conceded on reargument [Footnote 52] that no case could be cited that holds that a fetus is a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Constitution does not define \\\"person\\\" in so many words. Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains three references to \\\"person. \\\" The first, in defining \\\"citizens,\\\" speaks of \\\"persons born or naturalized in the United States. \\\" The word also appears both in the Due Process Clause and in the Equal Protection Clause. \\\"Person\\\" is used in other places in the Constitution: in the listing of qualifications for Representatives and Senators, Art. I, 2, cl. 2, and 3, cl. 3; in the Apportionment Clause, Art. I, 2, cl. 3; [Footnote 53] in the Migration and Importation provision, Art. I, 9, cl. 1; in the Emolument Clause, Art. I, 9, cl. 8; in the Electors provisions, Art. II, 1, cl. 2, and the superseded cl. 3; in the provision outlining qualifications for the office of President, Art. II, 1, cl. 5; in the Extradition provisions, Art. IV, 2, cl. 2, and the superseded Fugitive Slave Clause 3; and in the Fifth, Twelfth, andTwentysecond Amendments, as well as in 2 and 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment. But in nearly all these instances, the use of the word is such that it has application onlypostnatally. None indicates, with any assurance, that it has any possible prenatal application. [Footnote 54] [158] All this, together with our observation, supra, that, throughout the major portion of the 19th century, prevailing legal abortion practices were far freer than they are today, persuades us that the word \\\"person,\\\" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn. [Footnote 55] This is in accord with the results reached in those few cases where the issue has been squarely presented. Mc Garvey v. MageeWomens Hospital, 340 F. Sup p. 751 (W D Pa. 1972); By at, 285 N. E. 2d at 270; Montana v. Rogers, 278 F. 2d 68, 72 (CA7 1960), aff'd sub n om. Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U. S. 308 (1961); Keeler v. Superior Court, 2 Cal. 3d 619, 470 P. 2d 617 (1970); State v. Dickinson, 28 [159] Ohio St. 2d 65, 275 N. E. 2d 599 (1971). Indeed, our decision in United States v. Vuitch, 402 U. S. 62 (1971), inferentially is to the same effect, for we there would not have indulged in statutory interpretation favorable to abortion in specified circumstances if the necessary consequence was the termination of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection. This conclusion, however, does not of itself fully answer the contentions raised by Texas, and we pass on to other considerations. B. The pregnant woman cannot be isolated in her privacy. She carries an embryo and, later, a fetus, if one accepts the medical definitions of the developing young in the human uterus. See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 478-479, 547 (24th ed. 1965). The situation therefore is inherently different from marital intimacy, or bedroom possession of obscene material, or marriage, or procreation, or education, with which Eisenstadt and Gris wold, Stanley, Loving, Skinner, and Pierce and M eyer were respectively concerned. As we have intimated above, it is reasonable and appropriate for a State to decide that, at some point in time another interest, that of health of the mother or that of potential human life, becomes significantly involved. The woman's privacy is no longer sole and any right of privacy she possesses must be measured accordingly. Texas urges that, apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, life begins at conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that, therefore, the State has a compelling interest in protecting that life from and after conception. We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer. [160] It should be sufficient to note briefly the wide divergence of thinking on this most sensitive and difficult question. There has always been strong support for the view that life does not begin until live' birth. This was the belief of the Stoics. [Footnote 56] It appears to be the predominant, though not the unanimous, attitude of the Jewish faith. [Footnote 57] It may be taken to represent also the position of a large segment of the Protestant community, insofar as that can be ascertained; organized groups that have taken a formal position on the abortion issue have generally regarded abortion as a matter for the conscience of the individual and her family. [Footnote 58] As we have noted, the common law found greater significance in quickening. Physician and their scientific colleagues have regarded that event with less interest and have tended to focus either upon conception, upon live birth, or upon the interim point at which the fetus becomes \\\"viable,\\\" that is, potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid. [Footnote 59] Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks. [Footnote 60] The Aristotelian theory of \\\"mediate animation,\\\" that held sway throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance in Europe, continued to be official Roman Catholic dogma until the 19th century, despite opposition to this \\\"ensoulment\\\" theory from those in the Church who would recognize the existence of life from [161] the moment of conception. [Footnote 61] The latter is now, of course, the official belief of the Catholic Church. As one brief am icus discloses, this is a view strongly held by many non Catholics as well, and by many physicians. Substantial problems for precise definition of this view are posed, however, by new embryological data that purport to indicate that conception is a \\\"process\\\" over time, rather than an event, and by new medical techniques such as menstrual extraction, the \\\"morningafter\\\" pill, implantation of embryos, artificial insemination, and even artificial wombs. [Footnote 62] In areas other than criminal abortion, the law has been reluctant to endorse any theory that life, as we recognize it, begins before live birth, or to accord legal rights to the unborn except in narrowly defined situations and except when the rights are contingent upon live birth. For example, the traditional rule of tort law denied recovery for prenatal injuries even though the child was born alive. [Footnote 63] That rule has been changed in almost every jurisdiction. In most States, recovery is said to be permitted only if the fetus was viable, or at least quick, when the injuries were sustained, though few [162] courts have squarely so held. [Footnote 64] In a recent development, generally opposed by the commentators, some States permit the parents of a stillborn child to maintain an action for wrongful death because of prenatal injuries. [Footnote 65] Such an action, however, would appear to be one to vindicate the parents' interest and is thus consistent with the view that the fetus, at most, represents only the potentiality of life. Similarly, unborn children have been recognized as acquiring rights or interests by way of inheritance or other devolution of property, and have been represented by guardians ad l item. [Footnote 66] Perfection of the interests involved, again, has generally been contingent upon live birth. In short, the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense. X In view of all this, we do not agree that, by adopting one theory of life, Texas may override the rights of the pregnant woman that are at stake. We repeat, however, that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman, whether she be a resident of the State or a nonresident who seeks medical consultation and treatment there, and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life. These interests are separate and distinct. Each grows in substantiality as the woman approaches [163] term and, at a point during pregnancy, each becomes \\\"compelling. \\\" With respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in the health of the mother, the \\\"compelling\\\" point, in the light of present medical knowledge, is at approximately the end of the first trimester. This is so because of the now established medical fact, referred to above at 149, that, until the end of the first trimester mortality in abortion may be less than mortality in normal childbirth. It follows that, from and after this point, a State may regulate the abortion procedure to the extent that the regulation reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health. Examples of permissible state regulation in this area are requirements as to the qualifications of the person who is to perform the abortion; as to the licensure of that person; as to the facility in which the procedure is to be performed, that is, whether it must be a hospital or may be a clinic or some other place of lessthanhospital status; as to the licensing of the facility; and the like. This means, on the other hand, that, for the period of pregnancy prior to this \\\"compelling\\\" point, the attending physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the State, that, in his medical judgment, the patient's pregnancy should be terminated. If that decision is reached, the judgment may be effectuated by an abortion free of interference by the State. With respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in potential life, the \\\"compelling\\\" point is at viability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb. State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion [164] during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. Measured against these standards, Art. 1196 of the Texas Penal Code, in restricting legal abortions to those \\\"procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother,\\\" sweeps too broadly. The statute makes no distinction between abortions performed early in pregnancy and those performed later, and it limits to a single reason, \\\"saving\\\" the mother's life, the legal justification for the procedure. The statute, therefore, cannot survive the constitutional attack made upon it here. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider the additional challenge to the Texas statute asserted on grounds of vagueness. See United States v. Vuitch, 402 U. S. at67-72. XI To summarize and to repeat: 1. A state criminal abortion statute of the current Texas type, that excepts from criminality only a lifesaving procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests involved, is violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. (a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician. (b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. (c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life [165] may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. 2. The State may define the term \\\"physician,\\\" as it has been employed in the preceding paragraphs of this Part XI of this opinion, to mean only a physician currently licensed by the State, and may proscribe any abortion by a person who is not a physician as so defined. In Doe v. Bolt on, post, p. 179, procedural requirements contained in one of the modern abortion statutes are considered. That opinion and this one, of course, are to be read together. [Footnote 67] This holding, we feel, is consistent with the relative weights of the respective interests involved, with the lessons and examples of medical and legal history, with the lenity of the common law, and with the demands of the profound problems of the present day. The decision leaves the State free to place increasing restrictions on abortion as the period of pregnancy lengthens, so long as those restrictions are tailored to the recognized state interests. The decision vindicates the right of the physician to administer medical treatment according to his professional judgment up to the points where important [166] state interests provide compelling justifications for intervention. Up to those points, the abortion decision in all its aspects is inherently, and primarily, a medical decision, and basic responsibility for it must rest with the physician. If an individual practitioner abuses the privilege of exercising proper medical judgment, the usual remedies, judicial andintraprofessional, are available. XII Our conclusion that Art. 1196 is unconstitutional means, of course, that the Texas abortion statutes, as a unit, must fall. The exception of Art. 1196 cannot be struck down separately, for then the State would be left with a statute proscribing all abortion procedures no matter how medically urgent the case. Although the District Court granted appellant Roe declaratory relief, it stopped short of issuing an injunction against enforcement of the Texas statutes. The Court has recognized that different considerations enter into a federal court's decision as to declaratory relief, on the one hand, and injunctive relief, on the other. Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U. S. 241, 252-255(1967); Dombrowski v. P fister, 380 U. S. 479 (1965). We are not dealing with a statute that, on its face, appears to abridge free expression, an area of particular concern under Dombrowski and refined in Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. at 50. We find it unnecessary to decide whether the District Court erred in withholding injunctive relief, for we assume the Texas prosecutorial authorities will give full credence to this decision that the present criminal abortion statutes of that State are unconstitutional. The judgment of the District Court as to intervenor Hall ford is reversed, and D r. Hallford's complaint in intervention is dismissed. In all other respects, the judgment [167] of the District Court is affirmed. Costs are allowed to the appellee. It is so ordered. [For concurring opinion of MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, see post, p. 207. ][For concurring opinion of MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, see post, p. 209. ][For dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE WHITE, see post, p. 221. ]MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring. In 1963, this Court, in Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, purported to sound the death knell for the doctrine of substantive due process, a doctrine under which many state laws had in the past been held to violate the Fourteenth Amendment. As Mr. Justice Black's opinion for the Court in Skrupa put it: \\\"We have returned to the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws. \\\" Id. at 730. [Footnote 1] Barely two years later, in Gris wold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, the Court held a Connecticut birth control law unconstitutional. In view of what had been so recently said in Skrupa, the Court's opinion in Gris wold understandably did its best to avoid reliance on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as the ground for decision. Yet the Connecticut law did not violate any provision of the Bill of Rights, nor any other specific provision of the Constitution. [Footnote 2] So it was clear [168] to me then, and it is equally clear to me now, that the Gris wold decision can be rationally understood only as a holding that the Connecticut statute substantively invaded the \\\"liberty\\\" that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. [Footnote 3] As so understood, Gris wold stands as one in a long line of preSkrupa cases decided under the doctrine of substantive due process, and I now accept it as such. \\\"In a Constitution for a free people, there can be no doubt that the meaning of liberty' must be broad indeed. \\\" Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 572. The Constitution nowhere mentions a specific right of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life, but the \\\"liberty\\\" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment covers more than those freedoms explicitly named in the Bill of Rights. See Schwa re v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232, 238-239;Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 534-535;Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399-400. Cf. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, 629-630;United States v. Guest, 383 U. S. 745, 757-758;Carrington v. Rash, 380 U. S. 89, 96; Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500, 505; Kent v. Dulles, 357 U. S. 116, 127; Bolling v. Sharp e, 347 U. S. 497, 499-500;Truax v. Ra ich, 239 U. S. 33, 41. [169] As Mr. Justice Harl an once wrote: \\\"[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This 'liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints ..and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment. \\\" Poe v. Ull man, 367 U. S. 497, 543 (opinion dissenting from like.. 'liberty' ..were purposely left to gather meaning from experience. For they relate to the whole domain of social and economic fact, and the statesmen who founded this Nation knew too well that only a stagnant society remains unchanged. \\\" National Mutual Ins. Co. v. Tidewater Transfer Co. Co., 337 U. S. 582, 646 (dissenting opinion). Several decisions of this Court make clear that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 12; Gris wold v. Connecticut, supra; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra; M eyer v. Nebraska, supra. See also Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 166; Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U. S. 535, 541. As recently as last Term, in Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 453, we recognized \\\"the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person [170] as the decision whether to bear or beget a child. \\\" That right necessarily includes the right of a woman to decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. \\\"Certainly the interests of a woman in giving of her physical and emotional self during pregnancy and the interests that will be affected throughout her life by the birth and raising of a child are of a far greater degree of significance and personal intimacy than the right to send a child to private school protected in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 (1925), or the right to teach a foreign language protected in M eyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 (1923). \\\" Abele v. Mark le, 351 F. Sup p. 224, 227 (Conn. 1972). Clearly, therefore, the Court today is correct in holding that the right asserted by Jane Roe is embraced within the personal liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is evident that the Texas abortion statute infringes that right directly. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a more complete abridgment of a constitutional freedom than that worked by the inflexible criminal statute now in force in Texas. The question then becomes whether the state interests advanced to justify this abridgment can survive the \\\"particularly careful scrutiny\\\" that the Fourteenth Amendment here requires. The asserted state interests are protection of the health and safety of the pregnant woman, and protection of the potential future human life within her. These are legitimate objectives, amply sufficient to permit a State to regulate abortions as it does other surgical procedures, and perhaps sufficient to permit a State to regulate abortions more stringently, or even to prohibit them in the late stages of pregnancy. But such legislation is not before us, and I think the Court today has thoroughly demonstrated that these state interests cannot constitutionally support the broad abridgment of personal [171] liberty worked by the existing Texas law. Accordingly, I join the Court's opinion holding that that law is invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting. The Court's opinion brings to the decision of this troubling question both extensive historical fact and a wealth of legal scholarship. While the opinion thus commands my respect, I find myself nonetheless in fundamental disagreement with those parts of it that invalidate the Texas statute in question, and therefore dissent. I The Court's opinion decides that a State may impose virtually no restriction on the performance of abortions during the first trimester of pregnancy. Our previous decisions indicate that a necessary predicate for such an opinion is a plaintiff who was in her first trimester of pregnancy at some time during the pendency of her lawsuit. While a party may vindicate his own constitutional rights, he may not seek vindication for the rights of other s. Moose Lodge v. Ir vis, 407 U. S. 163 (1972); Sierra, Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727 (1972). The Court's statement of facts in this case makes clear, however, that the record in no way indicates the presence of such a plaintiff. We know only that plaintiff Roe at the time of filing her complaint was a pregnant woman; for aught that appears in this record, she may have been in her last trimester of pregnancy as of the date the complaint was filed. Nothing in the Court's opinion indicates that Texas might not constitutionally apply its proscription of abortion as written to a woman in that stage of pregnancy. Nonetheless, the Court uses her complaint against the Texas statute as a fulcrum for deciding that States may [172] impose virtually no restrictions on medical abortions performed during the first trimester of pregnancy. In deciding such a hypothetical lawsuit, the Court departs from the longstanding admonition that it should never \\\"formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied. \\\" Liverpool, New York Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113 U. S. 33, 39 (1885). See also Ash wander v. T VA, 297 U. S. 288, 345 (1936) (Brandeis, J. ,concurring). II Even if there were a plaintiff in this case capable of litigating the issue which the Court decides, I would reach a conclusion opposite to that reached by the Court. I have difficulty in concluding, as the Court does, that the right of \\\"privacy\\\" is involved in this case. Texas, by the statute here challenged, bars the performance of a medical abortion by a licensed physician on a plaintiff such as Roe. A transaction resulting in an operation such as this is not \\\"private\\\" in the ordinary usage of that word. Nor is the \\\"privacy\\\" that the Court finds here even a distant relative of the freedom from searches and seizures protected by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which the Court has referred to as embodying a right to privacy. Kat z v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967). If the Court means by the term \\\"privacy\\\" no more than that the claim of a person to be free from unwanted state regulation of consensual transactions may be a form of \\\"liberty\\\" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, there is no doubt that similar claims have been upheld in our earlier decisions on the basis of that liberty. I agree with the statement of MR. JUSTICE STEWART in his concurring opinion that the \\\"liberty,\\\" against deprivation of which without due process the Fourteenth [173] Amendment protects, embraces more than the rights found in the Bill of Rights. But that liberty is not guaranteed absolutely against deprivation, only against deprivation without due process of law. The test traditionally applied in the area of social and economic legislation is whether or not a law such as that challenged has a rational relation to a valid state Co., 348 U. S. 483, 491 (1955). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment undoubtedly does place a limit, albeit a broad one, on legislative power to enact laws such as this. If the Texas statute were to prohibit an abortion even where the mother's life is in jeopardy, I have little doubt that such a statute would lack a rational relation to a valid state objective under the test stated in Williams on, supra. But the Court's sweeping invalidation of any restrictions on abortion during the first trimester is impossible to justify under that standard, and the conscious weighing of competing factors that the Court's opinion apparently substitutes for the established test is far more appropriate to a legislative judgment than to a judicial one. The Court eschews the history of the Fourteenth Amendment in its reliance on the \\\"compelling state interest\\\" test. See Weber v. A etna Casualty Co., 406 U. S. 164, 179 (1972) (dissenting opinion). But the Court adds a new wrinkle to this test by transposing it from the legal considerations associated with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to this case arising under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Unless I misapprehend the consequences of this transplanting of the \\\"compelling state interest test,\\\" the Court's opinion will accomplish the seemingly impossible feat of leaving this area of the law more confused than it found it. [174] While the Court's opinion quotes from the dissent of Mr. Justice Holmes in Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 74 (1905), the result it reaches is more closely attuned to the majority opinion of Mr. Justice Peck ham in that case. As in Lochner and similar cases applying substantive due process standards to economic and social welfare legislation, the adoption of the compelling state interest standard will inevitably require this Court to examine the legislative policies and pass on the wisdom of these policies in the very process of deciding whether a particular state interest put forward may or may not be \\\"compelling. \\\" The decision here to break pregnancy into three distinct terms and to outline the permissible restrictions the State may impose in each one, for example, partakes more of judicial legislation than it does of a determination of the intent of the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment. The fact that a majority of the States reflecting, after all, the majority sentiment in those States, have had restrictions on abortions for at least a century is a strong indication, it seems to me, that the asserted right to an abortion is not \\\"so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental,\\\" Sny der v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934). Even today, when society's views on abortion are changing, the very existence of the debate is evidence that the \\\"right\\\" to an abortion is not so universally accepted as the appellant would have us believe. To reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment. As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature. Conn. S tat. ,Tit. 22, 14, 16. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth [175] Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion. [Footnote 1] While many States have amended or updated [176] their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today. [Footnote 3-2]Indeed, the Texas statute struck down today was, as the majority notes, first enacted in 1857, [177] and \\\"has remained substantially unchanged to the present time. \\\" Ante at 119. There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. The only conclusion possible from this history is that the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter. III Even if one were to agree that the case that the Court decides were here, and that the enunciation of the substantive constitutional law in the Court's opinion were proper, the actual disposition of the case by the Court is still difficult to justify. The Texas statute is struck down in toto, even though the Court apparently concedes that, at later periods of pregnancy Texas might impose these selfsame statutory limitations on abortion. My understanding of past practice is that a statute found [178] to be invalid as applied to a particular plaintiff, but not unconstitutional as a whole, is not simply \\\"struck down\\\" but is, instead, declared unconstitutional as applied to the fact situation before the Court. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356 (1886); Street v. New York, 394 U. S. 576 (1969). For all of the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent. Footnotes [Footnote 1] \\\"Article 1191.

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals disposed of that suggestion peremptorily, saying only, \\\"It is also insisted in the motion in arrest of judgment that the statute is unconstitutional and void in that it does not sufficiently define or describe the offense of abortion. We do not concur in respect to this question. \\\" Jackson v. State, 55 T ex. Cr. R. 79, 89, 115 S. W. 262, 268 (1908). The same court recently has held again that the State's abortion statutes are not unconstitutionally vague or over broad. Thompson v. State (Ct. C rim. App. T ex. 1971), appeal docketed, No. 71-1200. The court held that \\\"the State of Texas has a compelling interest to protect fetal life\\\"; that Art. 1191 \\\"is designed to protect fetal life\\\"; that the Texas homicide statutes, particularly Art. 1205 of the Penal Code, are intended to protect a person \\\"in existence by actual birth,\\\" and thereby implicitly recognize other human life that is not \\\"in existence by actual birth\\\"; that in[ 402 U. S. S.] Vuitch\\\" (402 U. S. 62); and that the Texas statute \\\"is not vague and indefinite or over broad. \\\" A physician's abortion conviction was affirmed. In Thompson, n. 2, the court observed that any issue as to the burden of proof under the exemption of Art. 1196 \\\"is not before us. \\\" But see Veevers v. State, 172 T ex. Cr.

[Footnote 22] Early philosophers believed that the embryo or fetus did not become formed and begin to live until at least 40 days after conception for a male and 80 to 90 days for a female. See, for example, Aristotle, Hist. A nim. 7. 3. 583b; Gen. A nim. 2. 3. 736, 2. 5. 741; Hippocrates, Li b. de Nat. P uer. ,No. 10. Aristotle's thinking derived from his three stage theory of life: vegetable, animal, rational. The vegetable stage was reached at conception, the animal at \\\"animation,\\\" and the rational soon after live birth. This theory, together with the 4080 day view, came to be accepted by early Christian thinkers. The theological debate was reflected in the writings of St. Augustine, who made a distinction between embryo inanimatus, not yet endowed with a soul, and embryo animatus. He may have drawn upon Exodus 21:22. At one point, however, he expressed the view that human powers cannot determine the point during fetal development at which the critical change occurs. See Augustine, De Origin e Ani mae 4. 4 (Pub. Law 44. 527). See also W. Re any, The Creation of the Human Soul, c. 2 and 83-86 (1932); H user, The Crime of Abortion in Canon Law 15 (Catholic Un iv. of America, Canon Law Studies No. 162, Washington, D. C. 1942). Galen, in three treatises related to embryology, accepted the thinking of Aristotle and his followers. Quay 426-427. Later, Augustine on abortion was incorporated by Gratian into the Decretum, published about 1140. Decretum Magis tri Gratiani 2. 32. 2. 7 to 2. 32. 2. 10, in 1 Corpus Juris Canonic i 1122, 1123 (A. Fried burg, 2d ed. 1879). This Decretal and the Decretal s that followed were recognized as the definitive body of canon law until the new Code of 1917. For discussions of the canon law treatment, see Means I, p p. 411-412; Noon an 20-26; Quay 426-430; see also J. Noon an, Contraception: A History of Its Treatment by the Catholic Theologians and Canonists 18-29 (1965). [Footnote 23] Br acton took the position that abortion by blow or poison was homicide \\\"if the foetus be already formed and animated, and particularly if it be animated. \\\" 2 H. Br acton, De Le gibus e t Consuetudinibus Anglia e 279 (T. T wiss ed. 1879), or, as a later translation puts it, \\\"if the foetus is already formed or quickened, especially if it is quickened,\\\" 2 H. Br acton, On the Laws and Customs of England 341 (S.

Y. L. F. 335 (1971) (hereinafter Means II). The author examines the two principal precedents cited marginally by Coke, both contrary to his dictum, and traces the treatment of these and other cases by earlier commentators. He concludes that Coke, who himself participated as an advocate in an abortion case in 1601, may have intentionally misstated the law. The author even suggests a reason: Coke's strong feelings against abortion, coupled with his determination to assert common law (secular) jurisdiction to assess penalties for an offense that traditionally had been an exclusively ecclesiastical or canon law crime. See also Lader 78-79,who notes that some scholars doubt that the common law ever was applied to abortion; that the English ecclesiastical courts seem to have lost interest in the problem after 1527; and that the preamble to the English legislation of 1803, 43 Geo. 3, c. 58, 1, referred to in the text, infra at 136, states that \\\"no adequate means have been hitherto provided for the prevention and punishment of such offenses. \\\" [Footnote 27] Commonwealth v.

The precise status of criminal abortion laws in some States is made unclear by recent decisions in state and federal courts striking down existing state laws, in whole or in part. [Footnote 38] \\\"Whereas, Abortion, like any other medical procedure, should not be performed when contrary to the best interests of the patient since good medical practice requires due consideration for the patient's welfare, and not mere acquiescence to the patient's demand; and\\\" \\\"Whereas, The standards of sound clinical judgment, which, together with informed patient consent, should be determinative according to the merits of each individual case; therefore be it\\\" \\\"RESOLVED, That abortion is a medical procedure and should be performed only by a duly licensed physician and surgeon in an accredited hospital acting only after consultation with two other physicians chosen because of their professional competency and in conformance with standards of good medical practice and the Medical Practice Act of his State; and be it further\\\" \\\"RESOLVED, That no physician or other professional personnel shall be compelled to perform any act which violates his good medical judgment. Neither physician, hospital, nor hospital personnel shall be required to perform any act violative of personally held moral principles. In these circumstances, good medical practice requires only that the physician or other professional personnel withdraw from the case so long as the withdrawal is consistent with good medical practice. \\\" Proceedings of the AMA House of Delegates 220 (June 1970). [Footnote 39] \\\"The Principles of Medical Ethics of the AMA do not prohibit a physician from performing an abortion that is performed in accordance with good medical practice and under circumstances that do not violate the laws of the community in which he practices. \\\" \\\"In the matter of abortions, as of any other medical procedure, the Judicial Council becomes involved whenever there is alleged violation of the Principles of Medical Ethics as established by the House of Delegates. \\\" [Footnote 40] \\\"UNIFORM ABORTION ACT\\\" \\\"SECTION 1. [Abortion Defined; When Authorized. ]\\\" \\\"(a) 'Abortion' means the termination of human pregnancy with an intention other than to produce a live birth or to remove a dead fetus. \\\" \\\"(b) An abortion may be performed in this state only if it is performed: \\\" \\\"(1) by a physician licensed to practice medicine [or osteopathy] in this state or by a physician practicing medicine [or osteopathy] in the employ of the government of the United States or of this state, [and the abortion is performed] [in the physician's office or in a medical clinic, or] in a hospital approved by the [Department of Health] or operated by the United States, this state, or any department, agency, [or political subdivision of either;] or by a female upon herself upon the advice of the physician; and\\\" \\\"(2) within [20] weeks after the commencement of the pregnancy [or after [20] weeks only if the physician has reasonable cause to believe (i) there is a substantial risk that continuance of the pregnancy would endanger the life of the mother or would gravely impair the physical or mental health of the mother, (ii) that the child would be born with grave physical or mental defect, or (iii) that the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, or illicit intercourse with a girl under the age of 16 years]. \\\" \\\"SECTION 2. [Penalty. ]Any person who performs or procures an abortion other than authorized by this Act is guilty of a [felony] and, upon conviction thereof, may be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding [1,000] or to imprisonment [in the state penitentiary] not exceeding [5 years], or both. \\\" \\\"SECTION 3. [Uniformity of Interpretation. ]This Act shall be construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of this Act among those states which enact it. \\\" \\\"SECTION 4. [Short Title. ]This Act may be cited as the Uniform Abortion Act. \\\" \\\"SECTION 5. [Sever ability. ]If any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this Act which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this Act are severable. \\\" \\\"SECTION 6. [Repeal. ]The following acts and parts of acts are repealed: \\\" \\\"(1)\\\" \\\"(2)\\\" \\\"(3)\\\" \\\"SECTION 7. [Time of Taking Effect. ]This Act shall take effect \\\". [Footnote 41] \\\"This Act is based largely upon the New York abortion act following a review of the more recent laws on abortion in several states and upon recognition of a more liberal trend in laws on this subject. Recognition was given also to the several decisions in state and federal courts which show a further trend toward liberalization of abortion laws, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy. \\\" \\\"Recognizing that a number of problems appeared in New York, a shorter time period for 'unlimited' abortions was advisable. The time period was bracketed to permit the various states to insert a figure more in keeping with the different conditions that might exist among the states. Likewise, the language limiting the place or places in which abortions may be performed was also bracketed to account for different conditions among the states. In addition, limitations on abortions after the initial 'unlimited' period were placed in brackets so that individual states may adopt all or any of these reasons, or place further restrictions upon abortions after the initial period. \\\" \\\"This Act does not contain any provision relating to medical review committees or prohibitions against sanctions imposed upon medical personnel refusing to participate in abortions because of religious or other similar reasons, or the like. Such provisions, while related, do not directly pertain to when, where, or by whom abortions may be performed; however, the Act is not drafted to exclude such a provision by a state wishing to enact the same. \\\" [Footnote 42] See, for example, YWCA v.

[Footnote 54] When Texas urges that a fetus is entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection as a person, it faces a dilemma. Neither in Texas nor in any other State are all abortions prohibited. Despite broad proscription, an exception always exists. The exception contained in Art. 1196, for an abortion procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother, is typical. But if the fetus is a person who is not to be deprived of life without due process of law, and if the mother's condition is the sole determinant, does not the Texas exception appear to be out of line with the Amendment's command? There are other inconsistencies between Fourteenth Amendment status and the typical abortion statute. It has already been pointed out, n 49, supra, that, in Texas, the woman is not a principal or an accomplice with respect to an abortion upon her. If the fetus is a person, why is the woman not a principal or an accomplice? Further, the penalty for criminal abortion specified by Art. 1195 is significantly less than the maximum penalty for murder prescribed by Art. 1257 of the Texas Penal Code. If the fetus is a person, may the penalties be different?

No paternal right has been asserted in either of the cases, and the Texas and the Georgia statutes on their face take no cognizance of the father. We are aware that some statutes recognize the father under certain circumstances. North Carolina, for example, N. C. Gen. S tat. 14-45. 1 (Sup p. 1971), requires written permission for the abortion from the husband when the woman is a married minor, that is, when she is less than 18 years of age, 41 N. C. A.

The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader. See United States v. Detroit Timber Lumber Co. ,200 U. S. 321, 337. SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus DO BBS, STATE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, E T AL v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION E T AL CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT No. 191392. Argued December 1, 2021Decided June 24, 2022 Mississippis Gestational Age Act provides that [e]xcept in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality, a person shall not intentionally or knowingly perform or induce an abortion of an unborn human being if the probable gestational age of the unborn human being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15) weeks. Miss. Code Ann. 4141191. Respondents Jackson Womens Health Organization, an abortion clinic, and one of its doctors challenged the Act in Federal District Court, alleging that it violated this Courts precedents establishing a constitutional right to abortion, in particular Roe v. Wade Wade, 410 U. S. 113, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Ca sey , 505 U. S. 833. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents and permanently enjoined enforcement of the Act, reasoning that Mississippis 15-week restriction on abortion violates this Courts cases forbidding States to ban abortion previability. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. Be fore this Court, petitioners defend the Act on the grounds that Roe and Ca sey were wrongly decided and that the Act is constitutional because it satisfies rational basis review. Held :The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Ca sey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives. P p. 879. (a) The critical question is whether the Constitution, properly understood, confers a right to obtain an abortion. Ca sey s controlling opinion skipped over that question and reaffirmed Roe solely on the basis of stare dec isis A proper application of stare dec isis ,however, requires an assessment of strength of the grounds on which Roe 2 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Syllabus was based. The Court therefore turns to the question that the Ca sey plurality did not consider. P p. 832. (1) First, the Court reviews th e standard that the Courts cases have used to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendments reference to liberty protects a particular right. The Constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion, but several constitutional provisions have offered as potential homes for an implicit constitutional right. Roe held that the abortion right is part of a right to privacy that springs from the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. See 410 U. S. ,at 152153. The Ca sey Court grounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an abortion is part of the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause. Other s have suggested that support can be found in the Fourteenth Amendments Equal Protection Clause, but that theory is squarely foreclosed by the Courts precedents, which establish that a States regulation of abortion is not a sex based classification and is thus not subject to th e heightened scrutiny that applies to such classifications. See Geduldig v. Aiel lo, 417 U. S. 484, 496, n. 20; Bray v. Alexandria Womens Clinic, 506 U. S. 263, 273 274. Rather, regulations and prohibitions of abortion are governed by the same standard of review as other health and safety measures. P p. 911. (2) Next, the Court examines whether the right to obtain an abor abortion is rooted in the Nations history and tradition and whether it is an essential component of ordered liberty. The Court finds that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nations history and tradition. The underlying theory on which Ca sey rested that the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for liberty has long been controversial. The Courts decisions have held that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of substantive rights those rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments to th e Constitution and those rights deemed fundamental that are mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. In deciding whether a right fa falls into either of these categories, the question is whether the right is deeply rooted in [our] history and tradition and whether it is essentia l to this Nations scheme of or ordered liberty. Ti mbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ,(internal quotation marks omitted). The term liberty alone provides little guidance. Thus, historical inquiries are essential whenever the Court is asked to recognize a new component of the liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. In interpreting what is meant by liberty, the Court must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse what the Fourteenth Am Amendment protects with the Courts own ardent views about the liberty that American s should enjoy. For this reason, 3 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Syllabus the Court has been reluctant to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution. Collins v. Hark er Heights Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125. Guided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of the Nations concept of ordered liberty, the Court finds the Fourteenth Amendment clearly does not protect the right to an abor abortion. Until the latter part of the 20t h century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years before Roe, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor had any scholarly treatise. Indeed, abortion had long been a crime in every single State. At common la w, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s ex expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three quarters of the States had made abor abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy. This consensus endured until the day Roe was decided. Roe either ignored or mi misstated this history, and Ca sey declined to reconsider Roes faulty historical analysis. Respondents argument that this history does not matter flies in the face of the standard the Court has applied in determining whether an asserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is never nevertheless protected by th e Fourteenth Amendment. The Solicitor General repeats Roes claim that it is doubtful abortion was ever firmly established as a common law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus, 410 U. S. ,at 136, but the great common law au thoritiesBracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstoneall wrote that a post quickening abortion was a crime. Moreover, many authorities asserted that even a prequickening abortion was unlawful and that, as a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from the attempt. The Solicitor General suggests that history supports an abortion right because of the common laws failure to criminalize abortion before quickening, but the insistence on quickening was not universal, see Mills v. Commonwealth ,13 Pa. 631, 633; State v. Slag le ,83 N. C. 630, 632, and regardless, the fact that many States in the late 18th and early 19th century did no t criminalize prequickening abortions does not mean that anyone th ought the States lacked the authority to do so. Instead of seriously pressing th e argument that the abortion right itself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Ca sey contend that the abortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right. Roe termed this a right to privacy, 410 U. S. ,at 154, and Ca sey described it as the freedom to make intimate and personal choices that are central to personal dignity and autonomy, 505 U. S. ,at 851. Ordered 4 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Syllabus liberty sets limits and defines th e boundary between competing interests. Roe and Ca sey each struck a particular balance between the in interests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interests of what they termed potential life. Roe Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 150; Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 852. But the people of the vari various States may evaluate those interests differently. The Nations historical understanding of ordered liberty does not prevent the peoples elected representatives from deciding how abortion should be regulated. P p. 1130. (3) Finally, the Court considers whether a right to obtain an abor abortion is part of a broader entrenched right that is supported by other precedents. The Court concludes the right to obtain an abortion cannot be justified as a component of such a right. Attempts to justify abor abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define ones concept of existence prove too much. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 851. Those criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, pros prostitution, and the like. What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Ca sey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion is different because it destroys what Roe termed potential life and what the law challenged in this case calls an unborn human being. None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Ca sey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. Ac Accordingly, those cases do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and the Courts conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way. P p. 3032. (b) The doctrine of stare dec isis does not counsel continued ac acceptance of Roe and Ca sey Stare dec isis plays an important role and protects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a past decision. It reduces incentives for challenging settled precedents, saving parties and courts th e expense of endless re litigation. Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC , 576 U. S. 446, 455. It contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process. Pay ne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827. And it restrains judicial hubris by respecting the judgment of th ose who grappled with important questions in the past. But stare dec isis is not an inexorable command, Pe arson v. Calla han , 555 U. S. 223, 233, and is at its weakest when [the Court] interpret[s] the Constitution, Agostini v. Felt on , 521 U. S. 203, 235. Some of the Courts most important constitutional decisions have overruled prior precedents. See, e. g. ,Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 491 (overruling the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson , 163 U. S. 537, and its progeny). The Courts cases have identified factors that should be considered in deciding when a precedent should be overruled. Janus v. State, County, and Employees, 585 U. S. ,.Five factors 5 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Syllabus discussed below weigh strong ly in favor of overruling Roe and Ca sey P p. 3966. (1) The nature of the Courts error Like the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson ,Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided. Ca sey perpetuated its errors, calling both sides of the national controversy to resolve their debate, but in doing so, Ca sey necessarily declared a winning side. Those on the losing side those who sought to advance the States interest in fetal life could no longer seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views. The Court short circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who disagreed with Roe. P p. 4345. (2) The quality of the reasoning Without any grounding in the constitutional text, hi story, or precedent, Roe imposed on the entire country a detailed set of rules for pregnancy divided into trimesters much like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation. See 410 U. S. ,at 163164. Roes failure even to note the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said about the common law was simply wrong. Then, after surveying his tory, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact finding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee, and did not explain why the source s on which it relied sh ed light on the mean ing of the Constitution. As to precedent, citing a broad array of cases, the Court found support for a constitutional right of personal privacy. Id. ,at 152. But Roe conflated the right to shield information from disclosure and the right to make and implement important personal decisions without governmental interference. See Whale n v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599600. None of these decisions involved what is distinctive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed potential life. When the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on the country, it asserted that its rules were consistent with, among other things, the relative weights of the respective interests involved and the demands of the profound problems of the present day. Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 165. These are precisely the sort of considerations that legislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that accommodate competing in interests. The scheme Roe produced looked like legislation, and the Court provided the sort of explanation that might be expected from a legislative body. An even more glaring deficiency was Roes failure to justify the critical distinction it drew between p re and post viability abortions. See id. ,at 163. The arbitrary viability line, which Ca sey termed Roe s central rule, has not found much support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted to justify a right to abortion. The most obvious problem with any such 6 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Syllabus argument is that viability has changed over time and is heavily dependent on factors such as medical advances and the availability of quality medical care that have nothing to do with the characteristics of a fetus. When Ca sey revisited Roe almost 20 years later, it reaffirmed Roes central holding ,but pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its reasoning. The Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and in stead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause. 505 U. S ,.at 846. The controlling opinion criticized and rejected Roe s trimester scheme, 505 U. S. ,at 872, and substituted a new and obscure undue burden test. Ca sey ,in short, either refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roes analysis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roes reasoning, endorsed what it termed Roe s central holding while suggesting that a majority might not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the abortion right other than Roes status as precedent, and imposed a new test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent. P p. 4556. (3) Workability Deciding whether a precedent should be overruled depends in part on whether the rule it imposes is workablethatis, whether it can be understood an d applied in a consistent and predictable manner. Ca sey s undue burden test ha s scored poorly on the workability scale. The Ca sey plurality tried to put meaning into the undue burden test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these rules created their own problems. And the difficulty of applying Case ys new rules surfaced in that very case. Compare 505 U. S. ,at 881 887, with id. ,at 920922 (Stevens, J. ,concurring in part and dissenting in part). The experience of th e Courts of Appeals provides further evidence that Ca sey s line between permissible and unconstitutional restrictions has proved to be impossible to draw with precision. Janus, 585 U. S. ,at Ca sey has generated a long list of Circuit conflicts. Continued adherence to Ca sey s unworkable undue burden test would undermine, not advance, the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles. Pay ne , 501 U. S. ,at 827. P p. 5662. (4) Effect on other areas of law Roe and Ca sey have led to the distortion of many important but un related legal doctrines, and that effect provides further support for overruling those decisions. See R amos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ,(K AVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring in part). P p. 6263. (5) Reliance interests. Overruling Roe and Ca sey will not upend concrete reliance interests like those that develop in cases involving property and contract rights. Pay ne , 501 U. S. ,at 828. In Ca sey ,the controlling opinion conceded that traditional reliance interests were 7 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Syllabus not implicated because getting an abortion is generally unplanned ac activity, and reproductive planning could take virtually immediate ac count of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions. 505 U. S. ,at 856. Instead, the opinion perceived a more intangible form of reliance, namely, that people [had] organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail and that [t]he ability of women to participate equally in the ec economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. Ibid. The contending sides in this case make impassioned and conflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right on the lives of women as well as the status of the fetus. The Ca sey pluralitys speculative attempt to weigh the relative importance of the interests of the fetus and the mother represent a departure from the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies. Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 729730. The Solicitor General suggests that overruling Roe and Ca sey would threaten the protection of other ri rights under the Due Process Clause. The Court emphasizes that this decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. P p. 6366. (c) Ca sey identified another concern, namely, the danger that the public will perceive a decision over ruling a controversial watershed decision, such as Roe, as influenced by political considerations or public opinion. 505 U. S. ,at 866867. But the Court cannot allow its decisions to be affected by such extraneous concerns. A precedent of this Court is subject to th e usual principles of stare dec isis under which adherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command. If the rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy would still be the law. The Courts job is to interpret the law, apply longstanding principles of stare dec isis ,and decide this case accordingly. P p. 6669. (d)Under the Courts precedents, rational basis review is the appropriate standard to apply when state abortion regulations undergo con constitutional challenge. Given that procuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional right, it follows that the States may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are chal challenged under the Constitution, courts cannot substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies. Ferguson , 372 U. S. ,at 729730. That applies even when the laws at issue con cern matters of great social significance and moral substance. A law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is entitled to a 8 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Syllabus strong presumption of validity. Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319. It must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would se serve legitimate state interests. Id. ,at 320. Mississippis Gestational Age Act is supported by the Mississippi Legislatures specific findings, which include the States asserted interest in protecting the life of the unborn. 2(b)(i).

DO BBS, STATE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, E T AL ,.PETITIONERS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION, ETALON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT [June 24, 2022] JUSTICE ALI TO delivered the opinion of the Court. Abortion presents a profound moral issue on which Americans hold sharply conflicting vi ews. Some believe fervently that a human person comes into being at conception and that abortion ends an innocent life. Other s feel just as strongly that any regulation of abortion invades a womans right to control her own body and prevents women from achieving full equality. Still other s in a third group think that abortion should be allowed under some but not all circumstances, and those within this group hold a variety of views about the particular restrictions that should be imposed. For the first 185 years after the adoption of the Constitution, each State was permitted to address this issue in ac accordance with the views of its citizens. Then, in 1973, this Court decided Roe v. Wade Wade, 410 U. S. 113. Even though the Constitution makes no mention of abortion, the Court held that it confers a broad right to obtain one. It did not claim that American law or the common law had ever recognized 2 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court such a right, and its survey of history ranged from the con constitutionally irrelevant (e. g ,.its discussion of abortion in antiquity) to the plainly incorrect (e. g. ,its assertion that abortion was probably never a crime under the common law). After cataloging a wealth of other information having no bearing on the meaning of the Constitution, the opinion concluded with a numbered set of rules much like those that might be found in a statute enacted by a legislature. Under this scheme, each trimester of pregnancy was regulated differently, but the most critical line was drawn at roughly the end of the second trimester, which, at the time, corresponded to the point at which a fetus was thought to achieve viability, i. e. ,the ability to survive outside the womb. Although the Court acknowledged that States had a legitimate interest in protecting potential life, 1 it found that this interest could not justify any restriction on previability abortions. The Court did not explain the basis for this line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard to defend Roes reasoning. One prominent constitutional scholar wrote that he would vote for a statute very much like the one the Court end[ed] up drafting if he were a legislator, but his assessment of Roe was memorable and brutal: Roe was not constitutional law at all and gave almost no sense of an obligation to try to be. 2 At the time of Roe ,30 States still prohibited abortion at all stages. In the years prior to that decision, about a third of the States had liberalized their laws, but Roe abruptly ended that political process. It imposed the same highly restrictive regime on the entire Nation, and it effectively struck down the abortion laws of every single State. 3 As 1 Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 163 (1973). 2J.

(2022) Opinion of the Court Justice Byron White aptly put it in his dissent, the decision represented the exercise of ra w judicial power, 410 U. S. ,at 222, and it sparked a national controversy that has embittered our political culture for a half century. 4 Eventually, in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Ca sey , 505 U. S. 833 (1992), the Court revisited Roe ,but the Members of the Court split three ways. Two Justices expressed no desire to change Roe in any way. 5 Four other s wanted to overrule the decision in its entirety. 6 And the three remaining Justices, who jointly signed the controlling opinion, took a third position. 7 Their opinion did not endorse Roes reasoning, and it even hinted that one or more of its authors might have reservations about whether the Constitution protects a right to abortion. 8 But the opinion concluded that stare dec isis ,which calls for prior decisions to be followed in most instances, required adherence to what it called Roe s central holding that a State may not constitutionally protect fetal life before viability even if that holding was wrong. 9 Anything less, the opinion claimed, would undermine resp ect for this Court and the rule of law. Paradoxically, the judgment in Ca sey did a fair amount of overruling. Several important abortion decisions were 4See R. Gins burg, Speaking in a Judicial Voice, 67 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1185, 1208 (1992) (Roe halted a political pr process that was moving in a reform direction and thereby, I believed, prolonged divisiveness and deferred stable settlement of the issue). 5See 505 U.

JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court overruled in toto ,and Roe itself was overruled in part. 10 Ca sey threw out Roe s trimester scheme and substituted a new rule of uncertain origin under which States were forbidden to adopt any regulation that imposed an undue burden on a womans right to have an abortion. 11 The decision provided no clear guidance about the difference between a due and an undue burden. But the three Justices who authored the controlling opinion call[ed] the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by treating the Courts decision as the final settlement of the question of the constitutional right to abortion. 12 As has become increasingly apparent in the intervening years, Ca sey did not achieve that goal. Americans continue to hold passionate and widely divergent views on abortion ,and state legislatures have acted accordingly. Some have recently enacted laws allowing abortion, with few re restrictions, at all stages of pregnancy. Other s have tightly restricted abortion beginning we well before viability. And in this case, 26 States have expressly asked this Court to overrule Roe and Ca sey and allow the States to regulate or pro prohibit previability abortions. Before us now is one such state law. The State of Mississippi asks us to uphold the constitutionality of a law that generally prohibits an abortion after the 15th week of pregnancy several weeks before the point at which a fetus i snow regarded as viable outs ide the womb. In defending this law, the States primary argument is that we should reconsider and overrule Roe and Ca sey and once again allow each State to regulate abortion as its citizens wish. On the other side, respondents and the Solicitor General ask us to 10 Id. ,at 861, 870, 873 (overruling Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc. Inc., 462 U.

Allowing Mississippi to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, they argue, would be no different than overruling Ca sey and Roe entirely. Brief for Respondents 43. They contend that no half measures are available and that we must either reaffirm or overrule Roe and Ca sey Brief for Respondents 50. We hold that Roe and Case y must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Ca sey now chiefly rely the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That provision has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be deeply rooted in this Nations history and tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. Washington v. Glucks berg, 521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). The right to abortion does not fall within this category. Until the latter part of the 20th century, such a right was entirely unknown in American law. Indeed, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three quarters of the States made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy. The abortion right is also critically different from any other right that this Court has held to fall within the Fourteenth Amendments protection of liberty. Roes defenders characterize the abortion right as similar to the rights recognized in past decisions involving matters such as intimate sexual relations, contraception, and marriage, but abortion is fundamentally different, as both Roe and Ca sey acknowledged, because it destroys what those decisions called fetal life and what the law now before us describes as an unborn human being. 13 Stare dec isis ,the doctrine on which Ca sey s controlling 13Miss. Code Ann. 4141191(4)(b) (2018). 6 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court opinion was based, does not compel unending adherence to Roes abuse of judicial authority. Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Ca sey have en flamed debate and deepened division. It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the peoples permissibility of abortion, and the limitations, upon it, are tobe resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 979 (Scalia, J. ,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). That is what the Constitution and the rule of law demand. I The law at issue in this case, Mississippis Gestational Age Act, see Miss. Code Ann. 4141191 (2018), contains this central provision: Except in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality, a person shall not intentionally or knowingly perform or induce an abortion of an unborn human being if the probable gestational age of the unborn human being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15) weeks. 4(b). 14 To support this Act, the legislature made a series of factual findings. It began by noting that, at the time of enactment, only six countries besides the United States permit[ted] nontherapeutic or elective abortionondemand after the twentieth week of gestation. 15 2(a). The le gisla 14The Act defines gestational age to be the age of an unborn human being as calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period of the pregnant woman. 3(f ). 15Those other six countries were Canada, China, the Netherlands, 7 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court t ure then found that at 5 or 6 weeks gestational age an unborn human beings heart begins beating; at 8 weeks the unborn human being begins to move about in the womb;at 9 weeks all basic physiological functions are present; at 10 weeks vital organs begin to function, and [h]air, fingernails, and toenails begin to form; at 11 weeks an unborn human beings diaphragm is developing, and he or she may move about freely in the womb; and at 12 weeks the unborn human being has taken on the human form in all relevant respects respects. 2(b)(i) (quoting Gonzales v. Car hart, 550 U. S. 124, 160 (2007)). It found that most abortions after 15 weeks employ dilation and evacuation procedures which involve the use of surgical instruments to crush and tear the unborn child, and it concluded that the intentional commitment of such acts for nontherapeutic or elective reasons is a barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the medical profession. 2(b)(i)(8). Respondents are an abortion clinic, Jackson Womens Health Organization, and one of its doctors. On the day the Gestational Age Act was enacted, respondents filed suit in Federal District Court various Mississippi officials, alleging that the Act violated this Courts precedents establishing a constitutional right to abortion.

JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents and permanently enjoined enforcement of the Act, reason ing that viability marks the earliest point at which the States interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions and that 15 weeks gestational age is prior to viability.

We granted certiorari, 593 U. S. (2021), to resolve the question whether all previability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional, Pet. for Cert. i. Petitioners primary defense of the Mississippi Gestational Age Act is that Roe and Ca sey were wrongly decided and that the Act is constitutional because it satisfies rational basis review. Brief for Petitioners 49. Respondents answer that allowing Mississippi to ban previability abortions would be no different than overruling Ca sey and Roe entirely. Brief for Respondents 43. They tell us that no half measures are available: We must either reaffirm or over rule Roe and Ca sey Brief for Respondents 50. II We begin by considering the critical question whether the Constitution, properly understood, confers a right to obtain an abortion. Skipping over t hat question, the controlling opinion in Ca sey reaffirmed Roes central holding based solely on the doctrine of stare dec isis ,but as we will explain, proper application of stare dec isis required an assessment of the strength of the grounds on which Roe was based. See infra, at 4556. We therefore turn to the question that the Ca sey plurality did not consider, and we address that question in three steps. First, we explain the standard that our cases have used in determining whether the Fourteenth Amendments reference to liberty protects a particular right. Second, 9 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court we examine whether the right at issue in this case is rooted in our Nations history and tradition and whether it is an essential component of what we have described as ordered liberty. Finally, we consider whether a right to obtain an abortion is part of a broader entrenched right that is supported by other precedents. A 1 Constitutional analysis must begin with the language of the instrument, Gibbons v. Ogden ,9 Wheat. 1, 186189 (1824), which offers a fixed standard for ascertaining what our founding document means, 1 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 399, p. 383(1833). The Constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion, and therefore those who claim that it protects such a right must show that the right is somehow implicit in the constitutional text. Roe, held that the abortion right, which is not mentioned in the Constitution, is part of a right to privacy, which is also not mentioned. See 410 U. S. ,at 152153. And that privacy right, Roe observed, had been found to spring from no fewer than five different constitutional provisions the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Id. ,at 152. The Courts discussion left open at least three ways in which some combination of these provisions could protect the abortion right. One possibility was that the right was founded in the Ninth Amendments reservation of rights to the people. Id. ,at 153. Another was that the right was rooted in the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendment, or in some combination of th ose provisions, and that this right had been incorporated into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment just as many other Bill of Rights provisions had by then been incorporated. Ibid; see 10 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court also McDonald v. Chicago Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 763766 (2010) (majority opinion) (discussing incorporation). And a third path was that the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments played no role and that the right was simply a component of the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause. Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 153. Roe expressed the feel[ing] that the Fourteenth Amendment was the provision that did the work, but its message seemed to be that the abortion right could be found somewhere in the Constitution and that specifying its exact location was not of paramount importance. 16 The Ca sey Court did not defend this unfocused analysis and instead grounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an abortion is part of the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause. We discuss this theory in depth below, but before doing so, we briefly address one additional constitutional provision that some of respondents ami ci have now offered as yet another potential home for the abortion right: the Fourteenth Amendments Equal Protection Clause. See Brief for United States as Am icus Curiae 24 (Brief for United States); see also Brief for Equal Protection Constitutional Law Scholars as Ami ci Curiae. Neither Roe nor Ca sey saw fit to invoke this theory, and it is squarely foreclosed by our precedents, which establish that a States regulation of abortion is not a sex based classification and is thus not subject to the heightened scrutiny that applies to such classifications. 17 The regulation of a medical procedure that 16The Courts words were as follows: This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendments concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendments reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. 410 U. S. ,at 153. 17See, e. g. ,Sessions v. MoralesSantana , 582 U. S. 47, (2017) (slip o p. ,at 8). 11 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court only one sex can undergo does not trigger heightened constitutional scrutiny unless the regulation is a mere pretex[t] designed to effect an in invidious discrimination against members of one sex or the other. Geduldig v. Aiel lo , 417 U. S. 484, 496, n. 20 (1974). And as the Court has stated, the goal of preventing abortion does not constitute invidiously discriminatory animus against women. Bray v. Alexandria Womens Health Clinic Clinic, 506 U. S. 263, 273274 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly ,laws regulating or prohibiting abortion are not subject to heightened scrutiny. Rather, they are governed by the same standard of review as other health and safety measures. 18 With this new theory addressed, we turn to Ca sey s bold assertion that the abortion right is an aspect of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 505 U. S. ,at 846; Brief for Respondents 17; Brief for United States 2122. 2 The underlying theory on which this argument rests that the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for liberty has long been controversial. But our decisions have held that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of substantive rights. The first consists of rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments. Those Amendments originally applied only to the Federal Government, Bar ron ex rel. Tier nan v. Mayor of Baltimore ,7 Pet. 243, 247251 (1833) (opinion for the Court by Marshall, C. J. ),but this Court has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the great majority of those rights and thus makes them equally applicable to the States. See McDonald, 561 18We discuss this standard in Part VI of this opinion. 12 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court U. S. ,at 763767, and n n. 1213. The second category which is the one in question here comprises a select list of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the Court has long asked whether the right is deeply rooted in [our] history and tradition and whether it is essential to our Nations scheme of ordered Indiana, 586 U. S. S., (2019) (slip o p. ,at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted); McDonald, 561 U. S. ,at 764, 767 (internal quotation marks omitted); Glucks berg , 521 U. S. ,at 721 (internal quotation marks omitted). 19 And in conducting this inquiry, we have engaged in a careful analysis of the history of the right at issue. Justice Gins burgs opinion for the Court in Ti mbs is a re cent example. In concluding that the Eighth Amendments protection against excessive fines is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty and deeply rooted in this Nations history and tradition, 586 U. S. ,at (slip o p. ,at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted), her opinion traced the right back to Mag na Car ta, B l ackstones Commentaries, and 35 of the 37 state constitutions in effect at the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. 586 U. S. ,at (slip o p. ,at 37). A similar inquiry was undertaken in McDonald ,which held that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms. The lead opinion surveyed the origins of the Second Amendment, the debates in Congress about 19See also, e. g. ,Duncan Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 148 (1968) (asking whether a right is among those fund amental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions institutions); Pal ko v. Connecticut Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325 (1937) (requiring a principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental (quoting Sny der v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934))). 13 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the state constitutions in effect when that Amendment was ratified (at least 22 of the 37 States protected the right to keep and bear arms), federal laws enacted during the same period, and other relevant historical evidence. 561 U. S. ,at 767777. Only then did the opinion conclude that the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty. Id. ,at 778; see also id. ,at 822850 (T (THOMAS ,J. ,concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (surveying history and reaching the same result under the Fourteenth Amendments Privileges or Immunities Clause). Ti mbs and McDonald concerned the question whether the Fourteenth Amendment protects rights that are expressly set out in the Bill of Rights, and it would be anomalous if similar historical support were not required when a putative right is not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. Thus, in Glucks berg ,which held that the Due Process Clause does not confer a right to assisted suicide, the Court surveyed more than 700 years of AngloAmerican common law tradition, 521 U. S. ,at 711, and made clear that a fundamental right must be objectively, deeply rooted in this Nations history and tradition, id. ,at 720721. Historical inquiries of this nature are essential whenever we are asked to recognize a new component of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause because the term liberty alone provides little guidance. Liberty is a capacious term. As Lincoln once said: We all declare for Liberty; but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing. 20 In a well known essay, Isaiah Berlin reported that [h]istorians of id eas had cataloged more than 20Address at Sanitary Fair at Baltimore, Md. (Apr. 18, 1864), reprinted in 7 The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln 301 (R. Bas ler ed. 1953). 14 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court 200 different senses in which the term had been used. 21 In interpreting what is meant by the Fourteenth Amendments reference to liberty, we must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse what that Amendment protects with our own ardent views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. That is why the Court has long been reluctant to recognize ri rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution. Collins v. Hark er Heights Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992). Substantive due process has at times bee na treacherous field for this Court, Moore v. East Cleveland Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion), and it has sometimes led the Court to us usurp authority that the Constitution entrusts to the people s elected representatives. See Regents of Un iv. of M ich. v. E wing , 474 U. S. 214, 225 226 (1985). As the Court cautioned in Glucks berg ,[w]e must exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field, lest the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the Members of this Court. 521 U. S. ,at 720 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). On occasion, when the Court has ignored the [a]ppropriate limits imposed by respect for the teachings of history, Moore, 431 U. S. ,at 503 (plurality opinion), it has fallen into the freewheeling judicial policy making that characterized discredited decisions such as Lochner v. New York York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). The Court must not fall prey to such an unprincipled approach. Instead, guided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of our Nations concept of ordered liberty, we must ask what the Fourteenth Amendment means by the term liberty. When we engage in that inquiry in the present case, the clear an answer is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect 21Four Essays on Liberty 121 (1969). 15 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court the right to an abortion. 22 B 1 Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in American law for a cons constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years before Roe was handed down, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor had any scholarly treatise of which we are aware. And although law review articles are not reticent about advocating new rights, the earliest article proposing a constitutional right to abortion that has come to our attention was published only a few years before Roe. 23 22That is true regardless of whether we look to the Amendments Due Process Clause or its Pr Privileges or Immunities Clause. Some scholars and Justices have maintained that the Privileges or Immunities Clause is the provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that gu guarantees substantive rights. See, e. g. g., McDonald v. Chicago Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 813850 (2010) (T (THOMAS ,J. ,concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Duncan, 391 U. S. ,at 165166 (Black, J. ,concurring); A.

Cros skey, Politics and the Constitution in the History of the United States 10891095 (1953). But even on that view, such a right would need to be rooted in the Nations history and tradition. See Cor field v. Cor yell, 6 F. Cas. 546, 551552 (No. 3,230) (CC ED Pa. 1823) (describing unenumerated rights under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Art.

JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court Not only was there no support for such a constitutional right until shortly before Roe, but abortion had long been a crime in every single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s ex expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy, and the remaining States would soon follow. Roe either ignored or misstated this history, and Ca sey declined to reconsider Roes faulty historical analysis. It is therefore important to set the record straight. 2 a We begin with the common law, under which abortion was a crime at least after quickening i. e. ,the first felt movement of the fetus in the womb, which usually occurs between the 16th and 18t h week of pregnancy. 24 articulate on paper the argument that a womans right to choose abor abortion was a fundamental individual fr freedom protected by the U. S. Constitutions guarantee of personal liberty). 24The exact meaning of quickening is subject to some debate. Compare Brief for Scholars of Jurisprudence as Ami ci Curiae 1214, and n. 32 (emphasis deleted) (a quick child meant simply a live child, and under the eras outdated knowledge of em bryology, a fetus was thought to become quick at around the sixth week of pregnancy), with Brief for American Historical Association e t al. as Ami ci Curiae 6, n. 2 (quick and quickening consistently meant the womans perception of fetal movement). We need not wade in to this debate. First, it suffices for present purposes to show that abortion was criminal by at least the 16th or 18th week of pregnancy. Second, as we will show, during the relevant period i. e. ,the period surrounding the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment the quickening distinction was abandoned as States criminalized abortion at a all stages of pregnancy. See infra ,at 21 17 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court The eminent common law authorities (Black stone, Coke, Hale, and the like), Kahler v. Kansas Kansas, 589 U. S. S., (2020) (slip o p. ,at 7), all describe abortion after quickening as criminal. Henry de Bract ons 13th-century treatise explained that if a person has struck a pregnant woman, or has given her poison, whereby he has caused abortion, if the foetus be already formed and animated, and particularly if it be animated, he commits homicide. 2 De Le gibus e t Consuetudinibus Anglia e 279 (T. T wiss ed. 1879); see also 1 Fl eta, c. 23, reprinted in 72 Selden Soc. 60 61 (H. Richardson G. Say les eds. 1955) (13th-centurytreatise). 25 Sir Edward Cokes 17th-century treatise likewise asserted that abortion of a quick child was murder if the childe be born alive and a great misprision if the childe die th in her body. 3 Institutes of the Laws of England 50 51 (1644). (Misprision referred to some hey nous offence under the degree of felony. Id. ,at 139. )Two treatises by Sir Matthew Hale likewise described abortion of a quick child who died in the womb as a great crime and a great misprision. Pleas of the Crown 53 (P. Glaze brook ed. 1972); 1 History of the Pleas of the Crown 433 (1736) (Hale). And writing near the time of the adoption of our Constitution, William Black stone explained that abortion of a quick child was by the ancient law homicide or manslaughter (citing Br acton), and at least a very heinous misdemeanor (citing Coke). 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 129130 (7th ed. 1775) (Black stone). English cases dating all the way back to the 13th century corroborate the treatises statements that abortion was a crime. See generally J. Dellapenna, Dispelling the Myths 25. 25Even before Bract ons time, English law imposed punishment for the killing of a fetus. See Leges Henric i Primi 222223 (L. Downer ed. 1972) (imposing penalty for any abortion and treating a woman who aborted a quick child as if she were a murderess). 18 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court of Abortion History 126, and n. 16, 134142, 188194, and n n. 8486 (2006) (Dellapenna); J. Keown, Abortion, Doctors and the Law 312 (1988) (Keown). In 1732, for example,Eleanor Be are was convicted of destroying the Foetus in the Womb of another woman and thereby causing her to miscarry. 26 For that crime and another misdemeanor, Be are was sentenced to two days in the pillory and three years imprisonment. 27 Although a prequickening abortion was not itself considered homicide, it does not follow that abortion was permissible at common law much less that abortion was a legal right Cf. Glucks berg , 521 U. S. ,at 713 (removal of common laws harsh sanctions did not represent an acceptance of suicide). Quite to the contrary, in the 1732 case mentioned above, the judge said of the charge of abortion (with no mention of quickening) that he had never met with a case so barbarous and unnatural. 28 Similarly, an indictment from 1602, which did not distinguish between a prequickening and post quickening abortion, described abortion as pernicious and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her crown and dignity. Keown 7 (discussing R. v. Webb, Calendar of Assize Records, Surrey Indictments 512(1980)). That the common law did not condone even prequickening abortions is confirmed by what one might call aprotofelonymurder rule. Hale and Black stone explained a way in which a prequickening abortion could rise to the level of a homicide. Hale wrote that if a physician gave a woman with child a potion to cause an abortion, and the woman died, it was murder because the potion was given unlawfully to destroy her child within her. 1 Hale 429 430 (emphasis added). As Black stone explained, to be 262 Gentlemans Magazine 931 (Aug. 1732). 27 Id. ,at 932. 28 Ibid. 19 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court murder a killing had to be done with malice aforethought, either express or implied. 4 Black stone 198 (emphasis deleted). In the case of an abortionist, Black stone wrote, the law will imply [malice] for the same reason that it would imply malice if a person who intended to kill one person accidentally killed a different person: [I]f one shoots at A and misses him, but kills B, this is murder; because of the previous felonious intent, which the law transfers from one to the other. The same is the case, where one lays poison for A; and B, against whom the prisoner had no malicious intent, takes it, and it kills him; this is likewise murder. So also ,if one gives a woman with child a medicine to procure abortion, and it operates so violently as to kill the woman, this is murder in the person who gave it. Id. ,at 200 201 (emphasis added; footnote omitted). 29 Notably, Black stone, like Hale, did not state that this protofelonymurder rule required that the woman be with quick child only that she be with child. Id. ,at 201. And it is revealing that Hale and Black stone treated abortionists differently from other physicians or surgeons who caused the death of a patient without any intent manslaughter. Hale 429. But a physician performing an abortion would, precisely because his aim was an unlawful one. In sum, although common law authorities differed on the severity of punishment for abortions committed at different 29Other treatises restated the same rule. See 1 W. Russell C. Greaves, Crimes and Misdemeanors 540 (5th ed. 1845) (So where a per son gave medicine to a woman to procure an abortion, and where a per son put skewers into the woman for th e same purpose, by which in both cases the women were killed, these acts were clearly held to be murder (footnotes omitted)); 1 E. East, Plea s of the Crown 230 (1803) (similar). 20 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court points in pregnancy, none endorsed the practice. Moreover, we are aware of no common law case or authority, and the parties have not pointed to any ,that remotely suggests a positive right to procure an abortion at any stage of pregnancy. b In this country, the historical record is similar. The most important early American edition of Black stones Commentaries, District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 594 (2008), reported Black stones statement that abortion of a quick child was at least a heinous misdemeanor, 2 St. George Tucker, Black stones Commentaries 129130 (1803), and that edition also included Black stones discus sion of the protofelonymurder rule, 5 id. ,at 200201. Manuals for justices of the peace printed in the Colonies in the 18th century typically restated the common law rule on abortion, and some manuals repeated Hales and Black stones statements that anyone who prescribed medication unlawfully to destroy the child would be guilty of murder if the woman died. See, e. g. ,J. Parker, Conductor Genera lis 220 (1788); 2 R. Burn, Justice of the Peace, and Parish Officer 221222 (7th ed. 1762) (English manual stating the same). 30 30For manuals restating one or both ru les, see J.

(2022) Opinion of the Court The few cases available from the early colonial period corroborate that abortion was a crime. See generally Dellapenna 215228 (collecting cases). In Maryland in 1652, for example, an indictment charged that a man Murtherously endeavoured to des troy or Murther the Child by him begotten in the Womb. Proprietary v. Mitchell, 10 Md. Archives 80, 183 (1652) (W. Browne ed. 1891). And by the 19th century, courts frequently explained that the common law made abortion of a quick child a crime. See, e. g. ,Smith v. Gaffard ,31 Ala. 45, 51 (1857); Smith v. State ,33 Me. 48, 55 (1851); State v. Cooper, 22 N. J. L. 52, 5255 (1849); Commonwealth v. Parker, 50 Mass. 263, 264268 (1845). c The original ground for drawing a distinction betweenpre and post quickening abortions is not entirely clear, but some have attributed the rule to the difficulty of proving that a prequickening fetus was alive. At that time, there were no scientific methods for detecting pregnancy in its early stages, 31 and thus, as one court put it in 1872: [U]ntil the period of quickening there is no evidence of life; and whatever may be said of the fe otus, the law has fixed upon this period of gestation as the time when the child is endowed with life because foetal movements are the first clearly marked and well defined evidences of life .Evans v. People ,49 N. Y. 86, 90 (emphasis added); Cooper, 22 N. J. L. ,at 56 (In contemplation of law life commences at the moment of quickening, at embryo gives the first physical proof of life ,no matter when it first received it (emphasis added)). 594, 595596, 26 N.

Rig by, A System of Midwifery 73 (1841) (Under all circumstances, the diagnosis of pregnancy must ever be difficult and obscure during the early months); see also id. ,at 7480 (discussing rudimentary techniques for detecting early pregnancy); A. Taylor, A Manual of Medical Jurisprudence 418421 (6th Am. ed. 1866) (same). 22 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court The Solicitor General offers a different explanation of the basis for the quickening rule, namely, that before quickening the common law did not regard a fetus as having a separate and independent existence. Brief for United States 26 (quoting Parker, 50 Mass. ,at 266). But the case on which the Solicitor General relies for this proposition also suggested that the criminal laws quickening rule was out of step with the treatment of prenatal life in other areas of law, noting that to many pu purposes, in reference to civil rights, an infant in vent re sa mere is regarded as a person in being. Ibid. (citing 1 Black stone 129); see also Evans, 49 N. Y. ,at 89; Mills v. Commonwealth, 13 Pa. 631, 633 (1850); Morrow v. Scott ,7 Ga. 535, 537 (1849); Hall v.

At any rate, the original ground for the quickening rule is of little importance for present purposes because the rule was abandoned in the 19th century. During that period, treatise writers and commentators criticized the quickening distinction as neither in accordance with the result of medical experience, nor with the principles of the common law. F. Wharton, Criminal Law 1220, p. 606 (rev. 4th ed. 1857) (footnotes omitted); see also J. Beck, Researches in Medicine and Medical Jurisprudence 2628 (2d ed. 1835) (describing the quickening distinction as absurd and in-jurious). 32 In 1803, the British Parliament made abortion 32See Mitchell v. Commonwealth ,78 Ky. 204, 209210 (1879) (ac knowledging the common law rule but arguing that the law should punish abortions and miscarriages, willfully produced, at any time during the period of gestation); Mills v. Commonwealth ,13 Pa. Pa., 631, 633 (1850) (the quickening rule never ought to have been the law anywhere); J. Bishop, Commentaries on the Law of Statutory Crimes 744, p. 471 (1873) (If we look at the reason of the law, we shall prefer a rule that discard[s] this doctrine of the necessity of a quickening); I.

One scholar has suggested that Parliaments decision may partly have been attributable to the medical mans concern that fetal life should be protected by the law at all stages of gestation. Keown 22. In this country during the 19th century, the vast majority of the States enacted statutes criminalizing abortion at all stages of pregnancy. See Appendix A, infra (listing state statutory provisions in chronological order). 33 By 1868, the year when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, three quarters of the States, 28 out of 37, had enacted statutes making abortion a crime even if it was performed before quickening. 34 See ibid.

Those scholars appear to have overlooked Rh ode Island, which criminalized abortion at all stages in 1861. See Ac ts and Resolves R. I. 1861, c h. 371, 1, p. 133 (criminalizing the attempt to procure the miscarriage of any pregnant woman or any woman supposed by such person to be pregnant, without mention of quickening). The am icus brief for the American Historical Association asserts that only 26 States prohibited abortion at all stages, but that brief incorrectly excludes West Virginia and Nebraska from its count. Compare Brief for American Historical Association 2728 (citing Quay), with Appendix A, infra 24 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court criminalized abortion at all stages, all but one did so by 1910. See ibid. The trend in the Territories that would become the last 13 States was similar: All of them criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy between 1850 (the Kingdom of Hawaii) and 1919 (New Mexico). See Appendix B, infra ;see also Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 952 (Rehnquist, C. J. ,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Dellapenna317319. By the end of the 1950s, according to the Roe Courts own count, statutes in all but four States and the District of Columbia prohibited abortion however and whenever performed, unless done to save or preserve the life of the mother. 410 U. S. ,at 139. 35 This overwhelming consensus endured until the day Roe was decided. At that time, also by the Roe Courts own count, a substantial majority30 States still prohibited abortion at all stages except to save the life of the mother. See id. ,at 118, and n. 2 (listing States). And though Roe discerned a trend toward liberalization in about one third of the States, those States still criminalized some abortions and regulated them more stringently than Roe would allow. Id. ,at 140, and n. 37; Tribe 2. In short, the 35The statutes of three States (M (Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) prohibited abortions performed unlawfully or without lawful justification. Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 139 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Massachusetts, case law held that abortion was allowed when, accord ing to the judgment of physicians in the relevant community, the procedure was necessary to preserve the womans life or her physical or emotional health. Commonwealth v. Wheeler Wheeler, 315 Mass. 394, 395, 53 N. E. 2d 4, 5 (1944). In the other two States, however, there is no clear support in case law for the proposition th at abortion was lawful where the mothers life was not at risk. See State v. Brandenberg, 137 N. J. L. 124, 58 A. 2d 709 (1948); Commonwealth v. Trombetta , 131 Pa. Super. 487, 200 A. 107 (1938). Statutes in the two remaining jurisdictions (the District of Columbia and Alabama) permitted abortion to preserve the mothers health. Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 139. Case law in those jurisdictions does not clarify the breadth of these exceptions. 25 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court Courts opinion in Roe itself convincingly refutes the notion that the abortion liberty is deeply rooted in the history or tradition of our people. Thorn burgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 793 (1986) (White, J. ,dissenting). d The inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nations history and traditions. On the contrary, an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973. The Court in Roe could have said of abortion exactly what Glucks berg said of assisted suicide: Attitudes toward [abortion] have changed since Br acton, but our laws have consistently condemned, and continue to prohibit, [that practice]. 521 U. S. ,at 719. 3 Respondents and their ami ci have no persuasive answer to this historical evidence. Neither respondents nor the Solicitor General disputes the fact that by 1868 the vast majority of States criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy. See Brief for Petitioners 1213; see also Brief for American Historical Association e t al. as Ami ci Curiae 2728, and n n. 1415 (conceding that 26 out of 37 States prohibited abortion before quickening); T r. of Oral A rg. 7475 (respondents counsel conceding the same). Instead, respondents are forced to argue that it does [not] matter that some States prohibited abortion at the time Roe was decided or when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. Brief for Respondents 21. But that argument flies in the face of the standard we have applied in determining whether an asserted right th atis nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is nevertheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Not only are respondents and their ami ci unable to show 26 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court that a constitutional right to abortion was established when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, but they have found no support for the existence of an abortion right that predates the latter part of the 20th century no state constitutional provision, no statute, no judicial decision, no learned treatise. The earliest sources called to our attention are a few district court and state court decisions decided shortly before Roe and a small number of law review articles from the same time period. 36 A few of respondents ami ci muster historical arguments, but they are very weak. The Solicitor General repeats Roe s claim that it is established as a common law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus. Brief for United States 26 (quoting Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 136). But as we have seen, great common law authorities like Br acton, Coke, Hale, and Black stone all wrote that a post quickening abortion was a crime and a serious one at that. Moreover, Hale and Black stone (and asserted that even a prequickening abortion was unlawful and that, as a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from the attempt. Instead of following these authorities, Roe relied largely on two articles by a pro abortion advocate who claimed that Coke had intentionally misstated the common law because of his strong anti abortion views. 37 These articles have 36See 410 U.

An internal memorandum characterized this authors work as donning the guise of impartial scholarship while advancing the proper ideological goals. 39 Con Continued reliance on such scholarship is unsupportable. The Solicitor General next suggests that history supports an abortion right because the common laws failure to criminalize abortion before quickening means that at the Founding and for decades th thereafter, women generally could terminate a pregnancy, at least in its early stages. 40 Brief for United States 2627; see also Brief for Respondents 21. But the insistence on quickening was not universal, see Mills ,13 Pa. ,at 633; State v. Slag le, 83 N.

See, e. g. ,June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Rus so , 591 U. S. (2020) (holding a law requiring doctors performing abortions to secure admitting privileges to be unconstitutional); Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt , 579 U.

Bolt on , 410 U.

JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court late 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize prequickening abortions does not mean that anyone thought the States lacked the authority to do so. When legislatures began to exercise that authority as the century wore on, no one, as far as we are aware, argued that the laws they enacted violated a fundamental right. That is not surprising since common law authorities had repeatedly condemned abortion and described it as an unlawful act without regard to whether it occurred before or after quickening. See supra, at 1621. Another am icus brief relied upon by respondents (see Brief for Respondents 21) tries to dismiss the significance of the state criminal statutes that were in effect when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted by suggesting that they were enacted for illegitimate reasons. According to this account, which is based almost entirely on statements made by one prominent proponent of the statutes, important motives for the laws were the fear that Catholic immigrants were having more babies than Protestants and that the availability of abortion was leading White Protestant women to shir[k their] maternal duties. Brief for American Historical Association e t al. as Ami ci Curiae 20. Resort to this argument is a testament to the lack of any real historical support for the right that Roe and Ca sey recognized. This Court has long disfavored arguments based on alleged legislative motives. See, e. g. ,Erie v. Paps M., 529 U. S. 277, 292 (2000) (plurality opinion); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 652 (1994); United States v. OBrien , 391 U. S. 367, 383 (1968); Arizona v. California California, 283 U. S. 423, 455 (1931) (collecting cases). The Court has recognized that inquiries into legislative motives are a hazardous matter. OBrien , 391 U. S. ,at 383. Even when an argument about legislative motive is backed by statements made by legislators who voted for a law, we 29 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court have been reluctant to attribute those motives to the legislative body as a whole. What motivates one legislator to make a speech about a statute is not necessarily what mo motivates scores of other s to enact it. Id. ,at 384. Here, the argument about legislative motive is not even based on statements by legislators, but on statements made by a few supporters of the new 19th-century abortion laws, and it is quite a leap to attribute these motives to all the legislators whose votes were responsible for the enactment of those laws. Recall that at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, over three quarters of the States had adopted statutes criminalizing abortion (usually at all stages of pregnancy), and that from the early 20th century until the day Roe was handed down, every single State had such a law on its books. Are we to believe that the hundreds of lawmakers whose votes were needed to enact these laws were motivated by hostility to Catholics and women? There is ample evidence that the passage of these laws was instead spurred by a sincere belief that abortion kills a human being. Many judicial decisions from the late 19th and early 20th centuries made that point. See, e. g. ,Nash v. M eyer ,54 Idaho 283, 301, 31 P. 2d 273, 280 (1934); State v. Ausplund ,86 Ore. 121, 131132, 167 P. 1019, 10221023 (1917); Trent v. State, 15 Ala. App. 485, 488, 73 S. 834, 836 (1916); State v. Miller ,90 Kan. 230, 233, 133 P. 878, 879 (1913); State v. Tip pie ,89 Ohio St. 35, 3940, 105 N. E. 75, 77 (1913); State v. Gedicke ,43 N. J. L. 86, 90 (1881); Dougherty v. People ,1 Co lo. 514, 522523 (1873); State v. Moore ,25 Iowa 128, 131132 (1868); Smith, 33 Me. ,at 57; see also Memphis Center for Reproductive Health v. Slater y ,14 F. 4th 409, 446, and n. 11 (CA6 2021) (Th apar, J. ,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (citing cases). One may disagree with this belief (and our decision is not based on any view about when a State should regard prenatal life as having rights or legally cognizable interests), 30 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court but even Roe and Ca sey did not question the good faith of abortion opponents. See, e. g. g., Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 850 (Men and women of good conscience can disagree about the profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy even in its ear liest stage). And we see no reason to discount the significance of the state laws in question based on these ami ci s suggestions about legislative motive. 41 C 1 Instead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right itself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Ca sey contend that the abortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right. Roe termed this a right to privacy, 410 U. S. ,at 154, and Ca sey described it as the freedom to make intimate and personal choices that are central to personal dignity and autonomy, 505 U. S. ,at 851. Ca sey elaborated: At the heart of liberty is the right to de fine ones own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Ibid. The Court did not claim that this broadly framed right is absolute, and no such claim would be plausible. While individuals are certainly free to think and to say what they 41Other am icus briefs present arguments about the motives of proponents of liberal access to abortion. They note that some such supporters have been motivated by a desire to suppress the size of the African American population. See Brief for A f ricanAmerican Organization e t al. as Ami ci Curiae 1421; see also Box v. Planned Parenthood of I nd. and Ky. ,Inc. Inc., 587 U. S. S., (2019) (T (THOMAS ,J. ,concurring) (slip o p. ,at 14). And it is beyond dispute that Roe has had that demographic effect. A highly disproportionate percentage of aborted fetuses are Black. See, e. g. g., De pt. of Health and Human Se rvs. ,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), K. Kortsmit e t al. ,Abortion Surveillance United States, 2019, 70 Morbidity and Mortality Report, Surveillance Summaries, p. 20 (Nov. 26, 2021) (Table 6). For our part, we do not question the motives of either those who have supported or those who have opposed laws restricting abortions. 31 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court wish about existence, meaning, the universe, and the mystery of human life, they are not always free to act in accordance with those thoughts. License to act on the basis of such beliefs may correspond to one of the many understandings of liberty, but it is certainly not ordered liberty. Ordered liberty sets limits and defines the boundary between competing interests. Roe and Ca sey each struck a particular balance between the interests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interests of what they termed potential life. Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 150 (emphasis deleted); Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 852. But the people of the various States may evaluate those interests differently. In some States, voters may believe that the abortion right should be even more extensive than the right that Roe and Ca sey recognized. Voters in other States may wish to impose tight restrictions based on their belief that abortion destroys an unborn human being. Miss. Code Ann. 4141191(4)(b). Our Nations historical understanding of ordered liberty does not prevent the peoples elected representatives from deciding how abortion should be regulated. Nor does the right to obtain an abortion have a sound basis in precedent. Ca sey relied on cases involving the right to marry a person of a different race, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); the right to marry while in prison, Turner v. Sa fley , 482 U. S. 78 (1987); the right to obtain contraceptives, Gris wold Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965), Eisenstadt v. Baird , 405 U. S. 438 (1972), Car ey v. Population Services In tl , 431 U. S. 678 (1977); the right to reside with relatives, Moore v. Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977); the right to make decisions about the education of ones chil children, Pierce v. Society of Sisters Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 (1925), M eyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 (1923); the right not to be steri sterilized without consent, Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williams on, 316 U. S. 535 (1942); and the right in certain circumstances not to undergo involuntary surgery, forced 32 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court administration of drugs, or other substantially similar procedures, Wins ton v. Lee, 470 U. S. 753 (1985), Harper, 494 U. S. 210 (1990), Ro chin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952). Respondents and the Solicitor General also rely on post Ca sey decisions like Lawrence Texas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003) (right to engage in private, consensual sexual acts), and Obergefell v. Hod ges , 576 U. S. 644 (2015) (right to marry a person of th e same sex). See Brief for Respondents 18; Brief for United States 2324. These attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define ones concept of existence prove too much. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 851. Those criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like. See Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 85 F. 3d 1440, 1444 (CA9 1996) (OScannlain, J. ,dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). None of these rights has any claim to being deeply rooted in history. Id. ,at 1440, 1445 What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Ca sey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions call potential life and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an unborn human being. See Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 159 (abortion is inherently different); Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 852 (abortion is a unique act). None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Ca sey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. They are therefore inapposite. They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way. 2 In drawing this critical distinction between the abortion right and other rights, it is not necessary to dispute Ca sey s claim (which we accept for the sake of argument) that the 33 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment do not mar[k] the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. 505 U. S. ,at 848. Abortion is nothing new. It has been addressed by lawmakers for centuries, and the fundamental moral question that it poses is ageless. Defenders of Roe and Ca sey do not claim that any new scientific learning calls for a different answer to the under lying moral question, but they do contend that changes in society require the recognition of a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Without the availability of abortion, they maintain, people will be inhibited from exercising their freedom to choose the types of relationships they desire, and women will be unable to compete with men in the workplace and in other endeavors. Americans who believe that abortion should be restricted press countervailing arguments about modern developments. They note that attitudes about the pregnancy of un married women have changed drastically; that federal and state laws ban discrimination on the basis of pregnancy; 42 that leave for pregnancy and childbirth are now guaranteed by law in many cases; 43 that the costs of medical care as so 42See, e. g. ,Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 92 S tat. 2076, 42 U.

See 124 S tat. 163, 42 U. S. C. 18022(b)(1)(D ).The A CA also prohibits annual limits, see 300gg11, and limits annual cost sharing obligations on such benefits, 18022(c). State Medicaid plans must provide coverage for pregnancy related services including, but not limited to, prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum c areas well as services for other conditions that might complicate the pregnancy. 42 C FR 440. 210(a)(2)(i)(ii) (2020). State Medicaid plans are also prohibited from imposing deductions, cost sharing, or similar charges for pregnancy related services for pregnant women. 42 U. S. C. 1396o(a)(2)(B), (b)(2)(B). 45Since Ca sey ,all 50 States and the District of Columbia have enacted such laws.

S. (2022) Opinion of the Court Both sides make important policy arguments, but supporters of Roe and Ca sey must show that this Court has the authority to weigh those arguments and decide how abortion may be regulated in the States. They have failed to make that showing, and we thus return the power to weigh those arguments to the people and their elected representatives. D 1 The dissent is very candid that it cannot show that a constitutional right to abortion has any foundation, let alone a deeply rooted one, in this Nations history and tradition. Glucks berg , 521 U. S. ,at 721; see post, at 1214 (joint opinion of B R EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ).The dissent does not identify any p re Roe authority that supports such a right no state constitutional provision or statute, no federal or state judicial precedent, not even a scholarly treatise. Compare post, at 1214, n. 2, with supra, at 1516, and n. 23. Nor does the dissent dispute the fact that abortion was illegal at common law at least after quickening; that the 19th century saw a trend toward criminalization of prequickening abortions; that by 1868, a s u per majority of States (at least 26 of 37) had enacted statutes criminalizing abortion at all stages of pregnancy; that by the late 1950s at least 46 States prohibited abortion however and whenever performed except if necessary to save the life of the mother, Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 139; and that when Roe was decided in 1973 similar statutes were still in effect in 30 States. Compare post, at 1214, n n. 23, with supra, at 2325, and n n. 3334. 47 The dissents failure to engage with this long tradition is Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965), was decided, the Connecticut st statute at issue was an extreme outlier. See Brief for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. as Am icus Curiae in Gris wold v. Connecticut ,O. T. 1964, No. 496, p. 27. 36 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court devastating to its position. We have held that the established method of substantivedueprocess analysis requires that an unenumerated right be deeply rooted in this Nations history and tradition before it can be recognized as a component of the liberty protected in the Due Process Clause. Glucks berg , 521 U. S. ,at 721; cf. Ti mbs , 586 U. S. ,at (slip o p. ,at 7). But despite the dissents professed fidelity to stare dec isis ,it fails to seriously engage with that important precedent which it cannot possibly satisfy. The dissent attempts to obscure this failure by misrepresenting our application of Glucks berg. The dissent suggests that we have focused only on the legal status of abortion in the 19th century, post, at 26, but our review of this Nations tradition extends well past that period. As explained, for more than a century after 1868including another half century after women gained the constitutional right to vote in 1920, see post, at 15; Amd t. 19it was established that laws prohibiting abortion like the Texas law at issue in Roe were permissible exercises of state regulatory authority. And today, ano another half century later, more than half of the States have asked us to overrule Roe and Ca sey. The dissent cannot establish that a right to abortion has ever been part of this Nations tradition. 2 Because the dissent cannot argue that the abortion right is rooted in this Nations history and tradition, it contends that the constitutional tradition is not captured whole at a single moment, and that its meaning gains content from the long sweep of our history and from successive judicial precedents. Post, at 18 (internal quotation marks omitted). This vague formulation imposes no clear restraints on what Justice White called the exercise of raw judicial power, Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 222 (dissenting opinion), and while the dissent claims that its standard does not mean 37 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court anything goes, post, at 17, any real restraints are hard to discern. The largely limitless reach of the dissenters standard is illustrated by the way they apply it here. First, if the long sweep of history imposes any restraint on the recognition of unenumerated rights, then Roe was surely wrong, since abortion was never allowed (except to save the life of the mother) in a majority of States for over 100 years before that decision was handed down. Second, it is impossible to defend Roe based on prior precedent because all of the precedents Roe cited, including Gris wold and Eisenstadt ,were critically different for a reason that we have explained: None of those cases involved the destruction of what Roe called potential life. See supra, at 32. So without support in history or relevant precedent, Roes reasoning cannot be defended even under the dissents proposed test, and the dissent is force d to rely solely on the fact that a constitutional right to abortion was recognized in Roe and later decisions that accepted Roes interpretation. Under the doctrine of stare dec isis ,those precedents are entitled to careful and respectful consideration, and we engage in that analysis below. But as the Court has reiterated time and time again, adherence to precedent is not an inexorable command. Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC , 576 U. S. 446, 455 (2015). There are occasions when past decisions should be overruled, and as we will explain, this is one of them. 3 The most striking feature of the dissent is the absence of any serious discussion of the legitimacy of the States interest in protecting fetal life. This is evident in the analogy that the dissent draws between the abortion right and the rights recognized in Gris wold (contraception), Eisenstadt (same), Lawrence (sexual conduct with member of the same sex), and Obergefell (same sex marriage). Perhaps this is 38 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court designed to stoke unfounded fear that our decision will imperil those other rights, but the dissents analogy is objectionable for a more important reason: what it reveals about the dissents views on the protection of what Roe called potential life. The exercise of the rights at issue in Gris wold , Eisenstadt ,Lawrence ,and Obergefell does not destroy a potential life, but an abortion has that effect. So if the right sat issue in those cases are fundamentally the same as the right recognized in Roe and Ca sey ,the implication is clear: The Constitution does not permit the States to regard the destruction of a potential life as a matter of any significance. That view is evident throughout the dissent. The dissent has much to say about the effects of pregnancy on women, the burdens of motherhood, and the difficulties faced by poor women. These are import ant concerns. However, the dissent evinces no similar regard for a States interest in protecting prenatal life. The dissent repeatedly praises the balance, post, at 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, that the viability line strikes between a womans liberty interest and the States interest in prenatal life. But for reasons we discuss later, see infra, at 5054, 5556, and given in the opinion of T HE CHIEF JUSTICE ,post, at 25 (opinion concurring in judgment), the viability line makes no sense. It was not adequately justified in Roe, and the dissent does not even try to defend it today. Nor does it identify any other point in a pregnancy after which a State is permitted to prohibit the destruction of a fetus. Our opinion is not based on any view about if and when prenatal life is entitled to any of the rights enjoyed after birth. The dissent, by contrast, would impose on the people a particular theory about when the rights of personhood begin. According to the dissent, the Constitution requires the States to regard a fetus as lacking even the most basic human right to liv eat least until an arbitrary point in a pregnancy has passed. Nothing in the Constitution or in 39 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court our Nations legal traditions authorizes the Court to adopt that theory of life. Post ,at 8. III We next consider whether the doctrine of stare dec isis counsels continued acceptance of Roe and Ca sey Stare dec isis plays an important role in our case law, and we have explained that it serves many valuable ends. It protects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a past decision. See Ca sey , 505 Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991). It reduces incentives for challenging settled precedents, saving parties and courts the expense of endless re litigation. Kimble , 576 U. S. ,at 455. It fosters evenhanded de ci sion making by requiring that like cases be decided in a like manner. Pay ne , 501 U. S. ,at 827. It contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process. Ibid. And it restrains judicial hubris and reminds us to respect the judgment of those who have grappled with important questions in the past. Precedent is a way of accumulating and passing down the learning of past generations, a font of established wisdom richer than what can be found in any single judge or panel of judges. N. Gor such, A Republic, If You Can Keep It 217 (2019). We have long recognized, however, that stare dec isis is not an inexorable command, Pe arson v. Calla han , 555 U. S. 223, 233 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted), and it is at its weakest when we interpret the Constitution, Agostini v. Felt on , 521 U. S. 203, 235 (1997). It has been said that it is sometimes more important that an issue be settled than that it be settled right. Kimble , 576 U. S. ,at Co,. 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J. ,dissenting)). But when it comes to the interpretation of the Constitution the great charter of our liberties, which was meant to en 40 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court dure through a long lapse of ages, Martin v. Hunters Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 326 (1816) (opinion for the Court by Story, J. )we place a high value on having the matter settled right. In addition, when one of our constitutional decisions goes astray, the country is usually stuck with the bad decision unless we correct our own mistake. An erroneous constitutional decision can be fixed by amending the Constitution, but our Constitution is notoriously hard to amend. See Art. V; Kimble , 576 U. S. ,at 456. Therefore, in appropriate circumstances we mu st be willing to reconsider and, if necessary, overrule constitutional decisions. Some of our most important constitutional decisions have overruled prior precedents. We mention three. In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), the Court repudiated the separate but equal doctrine, which had allowed States to maintain racially segregated schools and other facilities. Id. ,at 488 (internal quotation marks omitted). In so doing, the Court overruled the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson , 163 U. S. 537 (1896), along with six other Supreme Court precedents that had applied the separatebutequal rule. See Brown, 347 U. S. ,at 491. In West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish ,300 U. S. 379 (1937), the Court overruled Ad kins v. Children s Hospital of D. C. C., 261 U. S. 525 (1923), which had held that a law setting minimum wages for women violated the liberty protected by the Fifth Amendments Due Process Clause. Id. ,at 545. West Coast Hotel signaled the demise of an entire line of important precedents that had protected an individual liberty right against state and fe federal health and welfare legislation. See Lochner v. New York York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905) (holding invalid a law setting maximum working hours); Cop page v. Kansas Kansas, 236 U. S. 1 (1915) (holding invalid a law banning contracts forbidding employees to join a union); Jay Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan, 264 U. S. 504 (1924) (holding invalid laws fixing the weight of loaves of bread). Finally, in West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 41 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court 624 (1943), after the lapse of only three years, the Court overruled Miners ville School D ist. v. Go bitis , 310 U. S. 586 (1940), and held that public school students could not be compelled to salute the flag in violation of beliefs. Barnette stands out because nothing had changed during the intervening period other than the Courts belated recognition that its earlier decision had been seriously wrong. On many other occasions, this Court has overruled important constitutional decision s.

S. 1, 78 (1964) (congressional districts should be apportioned so that as nearly as is practicable one mans vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as another s), overruling in effect Cole grove v.

Carr, 369 U. S. 186 (1962) (federal courts have jurisdiction to consider constitutional challenges to state re districting plans), effectively overruling in part Cole grove , 328 U. S. 549; 43 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court American constitutional law as we know it would be unrecognizable, and this would be a different country. No Justice of this Court has ever argued that the Court should never overrule a constitutional decision, but overruling a precedent is a serious matter. It is not a step that should be taken lightly. Our cases have attempted to provide a framework for deciding when a precedent should be overruled, and they have identified factors that should be considered in making such a decision. Janus v. State, County, and Employees, 585 U. S. S., (2018) (slip o p. ,at 3435); R amos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. S., (2020) (K AVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring in part) (slip o p. ,at 79). In this case, five factors weigh strongly in favor of overruling Roe and Ca sey :the nature of their error, the quality of their reasoning, the workability of the rules they imposed on the country, their disruptive effect on other areas of the law, and the absence of concrete reliance. A The nature of the Courts error An erroneous interpretation of the Constitution is always important, but some are more damaging than other s. The infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson ,was one Map p v. Ohio Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961) (the exclusionary rule regarding the inadmissibility of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment applies to the States), overruling Wolf v. Colorado Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949); Smith v. All wright , 321 U. S. 649 (1944) (racial restrictions on the right to vote in primary elections violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment), overruling Grove y v. Townsend, 295 U. S. 45 (1935); United States v. Darby Darby, 312 U. S. 100 (1941) (con (congressional power to regulate employment conditions under the Commerce Clause), overruling Hammer v. Dagenhart , 247 U. S. 251 (1918); Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938) (Congress does not have the power to declare substantive rules of common law; a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction must apply the substantive st ate law), overruling Swift v. Tyson ,16 Pet. 1 (1842). 44 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court such decision. It betrayed our commitment to equality before the law. 163 U. S. ,at 562 (Harl an, J. ,dissenting). It was egregiously wrong on the day it was decided, see R amos, 590 U. S. ,at (opinion of K AVANAUGH ,J. )(slip o p. ,at 7), and as the Solicitor Gene General agreed at oral argument, it should have been overruled at the earliest opportunity, see T r. of Oral A rg. 9293. Roe was also egregiously wrong and deeply damaging. For reasons already explained, Roes constitutional analysis was far outside the bounds of any reasonable interpretation of the various constitutional provisions to which it vaguely pointed. Roe was on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided, Ca sey perpetuated its errors, and those errors do not concern some arcane corner of the law of little importance to the American people. Rather, wielding nothing but raw judicial power, Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 222 (White, J. ,dissenting), the Court usurped the power to address a question of profound moral and social importance that the Constitution unequivocally leaves for the people. Ca sey described itself as calling both sides of the national controversy to resolve their debate, but in doing so, Ca sey necessarily declared a winning side. Those on the losing side those who sought to advance the States interest in fetal life could no longer seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views. The Court short circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who dissented in any respect from Roe. Roe fanned into life an issue that has inflamed our national politics in general, and has obscured with its smoke the selection of Justices to this Court in particular, ever since. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 995996 (opinion of Scalia, J. ).Together, Roe and Ca sey represent an error that cannot be allowed to stand. As the Courts landmark decision in West Coast Hotel illustrates, the Court has previously overruled decisions that 45 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court wrongly removed an issue from the people and the democratic process. As Justice Whit e later explained, decisions that find in the Constitution principles or values that cannot fairly be read into that document usurp the peoples au authority, for such decisions represent choices that the people have never made and that they cannot disavow through corrective legislation. For this reason, it is essential that this Court maintain the power to re store authority to its proper possessors by correcting constitutional decisions that, on re consideration, are found to be mistaken. Thorn burgh , 476 U. S. ,at 787 (dissenting opinion). B The quality of the reasoning Under our precedents, the quality of the reasoning in a prior case has an important bearing on whether it should be reconsidered. See Janus Janus, 585 U. S. ,at (slip o p. ,at 38); R amos , 590 U. S. ,at (opinion of K AVANAUGH ,J. )(slip o p. ,at 78). In Part II, supra, we explained why Roe was incorrectly decided, but that decision was more than just wrong. It stood on exceptionally weak grounds. Roe found that the Constitution implicitly conferred a right to obtain an abortion, but it failed to ground its decision in text, history, or precedent. It relied on an erroneous historical narrative; it devote d great attention to and presumably relied on matters that have no bearing on the meaning of the Constitution; it disregarded the fundamental difference between the precedents on which it relied and the question before the Court; it concocted an elaborate set of rules, with different res restrictions for each trimester of pregnancy, but it did not explain how this veritable code could be teased out of anything in the Constitution, the history of abortion laws, prior precedent, or any other cited source; and its most important rule (that States cannot protect fetal life prior to viability) was never raised by any 46 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court party and has never been plausibly explained. Roes reasoning quickly drew scathing scholarly criticism, even from supporters of broad access to abortion. The Ca sey plurality, while reaffirming Roes central hold ing, pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its reasoning. It revised the textual bas is for the abortion right, silently abandoned Roes erroneous historical narrative, and jettisoned the trimester framework. But it replaced that scheme with an arbitrary undue burden test and relied on an exceptional version of stare dec isis that, as explained be low, this Court had never before applied and has never invoked since. 1 a The weaknesses in Roes reasoning are well known. Without any grounding in the constitutional text, history, or precedent, it imposed on the entire country a detailed set of rules much like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation. See 410 U. S. ,at 163164. Dividing pregnancy into three trimesters, the Court imposed special rules for each. During the first trimester, the Court announced, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant womans attending physician. Id. ,at 164. After that point, a States interest in regulating abortion for the sake of a womans health became compelling, and accordingly, a State could regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. Ibid. Finally, in the stage subsequent to viability, which in 1973 roughly coincided with the beginning of the third trimester, the States interest in the potentiality of human life became compelling, and therefore a State could regulate, and even proscribe ,abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. Id. ,at 164165. 47 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court This elaborate scheme was the Courts own brainchild. Neither party advocated the trimester framework; nor did either party or any am icus argue that viability should mark the point at which the scope of the abortion right and a States regulatory authority should be substantially transformed. See Brief for Appellant and Brief for Appellee in Roe v. Wade ,O. T. 1972, No. 7018; see also C. Forsythe, Abuse of Discretion: The Inside Story of Roe v. Wade 127, 141 (2012). b Not only did this scheme re semble the work of a legislature, but the Court made little effort to explain how these rules could be deduced from any of the sources on which constitutional decisions are usually based. We have already discussed Roes treatment of constitutional text, and the opinion failed to show that history, precedent, or any other cited source supported its scheme. Roe featured a lengthy survey of history, but much of its discussion was irrelevant, and the Court made no effort to explain why it was included. For example, multiple paragraphs were devoted to an account of the views and practices of ancient civilizations where infanticide was widely accepted. See 410 U. S. ,at 130132 (discussing ancient Greek and Roman practices). 49 When it came to the most important historical fact how the States regulated abortion when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted the Court said almost nothing. It allowed that States had tightened their abortion laws in the middle and late 19th century, id. ,at 139, but it implied that these laws might have 49See, e. g. ,C. Patter son, Not Worth the Rearing: The Causes of Infant Exposure in Ancient Greece, 115 Transactions Am. Philosophical As sn. 103, 111123 (1985); A. Came ron, The Exposure of Children and Greek Ethics, 46 Classical Rev. 105108 (1932); H. Bennett, The Exposure of Infants in Ancient Rome, 18 Classical J. 341351 (1923); W. Harris, Child Exposure in the Roman Empire, 84 J. Roman Studies 1 (1994). 48 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court been enacted not to protect fetal life but to further a Victorian social concern about illicit sexual conduct, id. ,at 148. Roes failure even to note the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said about the common law was simply wrong. Relying on two discredited articles by an abo abortion advocate, the Court er erroneously suggested contrary to Br acton, Coke, Hale, Black stone, and a wealth of other authority that the common law had probably never really treated post quickening abortion as a crime. See id. ,at 136 ([I]t now appear[s] doubtful that abortion was ever firmly established as a common law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus). This erroneous understanding appears to have played an important part in the Courts thinking because the opinion cited the lenity of the common law as one of the four factors that informed its decision. Id. ,at 165. After surveying history, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact finding that undertaken by a legislative committee. This included a lengthy account of the position of the American Medical Association and [t]he position of the American Public Health Association, as well as the vote by the American Bar Associations House of Delegates in February 1972 on proposed abortion legislation. Id ,.at 141, 144, 146 (emphasis deleted). Also noted were a British judicial decision handed down in 1939 and a new British abortion law enacted in 1967. Id. ,at 137138. The Court did not explain why these sources shed light on the meaning of the Constitution, and not one of them adopted or advocated anything like the scheme that Roe imposed on the country. Finally, after all this, the Court turned to precedent. Cit ing a broad array of cases, the Court found support for a constitutional right of personal privacy, id. ,at 152, but it conflated two very different meanings of the term: the right 49 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court to shield information from disc disclosure and the right to make and implement important personal decisions without governmental interference. See Whale n v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599600 (1977). Only the cases involving this second sense of the term could have any possible relevance to the abortion issue, and some of the cases in that category involved personal decisions that were ob obviously very, very far afield. See Pierce Pierce, 268 U. S. 510 (right to send children to religious school); M eyer , 262 U. S. 390 (right to have children receive German language instruction). What remained was a handful of cases having something to do with marriage, Loving Loving, 388 U. S. 1 (right to marry a person of a different ra ce), or procreation, Skinner Skinner, 316 U. S. 535 (right not to be sterilized); Gris wold, 381 U. S. 479 (right of married persons to obtain contraceptives); Eisenstadt , 405 U. S. 438 (same, for unmarried persons). But none of these decisions involved what is distinctive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed potential life. When the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on the country, it asserted that its rules were consistent with the following: (1) the relative weights of the respective interests involved, (2) the lessons and exam examples of medical and legal history, (3) the lenity of the common law, and (4) the demands of the profound problems of the present day. Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 165. Put aside the second and third factors, which were based on the Courts flawed account of history, and what remains are precisely the sort of considerations that legislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that accommodate competing interests. The scheme Roe produced looked like legislation, and the Court provided the sort of explanation that might be expected from a legislative body. c What Roe did not provide was any cogent justification for the lines it drew. Why, for example, does a State have no 50 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court authority to regulate first trimester abortions for the purpose of protecting a womans health? The Courts only ex planation was that mortality rates for abortion at that stage were lower than the mortality rates for childbirth. Id. ,at 163. But the Court did not explain why mortality rates were the only factor that a State could legitimately consider. Many health and safety regulations aim to avoid adverse health consequences short of death. And the Court did not explain why it departed from the normal rule that courts defer to the judgment s of legislatures in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties. Marshall v. United States States, 414 U. S. 417, 427 (1974). An even more glaring deficiency was Roe s failure to justify the critical distinction it drew between p re and post viability abortions. Here is the Courts entire explanation: With respect to the States important and legitimate interest in potential life, the compelling point is at viability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the womb. 410 U. S. ,at 163. As Professor Laurence Tribe has written, [c]learly, this mistakes a definition for a syllogism. Tribe 4 (quoting E ly 924). The definition of a viable fetus is one that is capable of surviving outside the womb, but why is this the point at which the States interest becomes compelling? If, as Roe held, a States interest in protecting prenatal life is compelling after viability, 410 U. S. ,at 163, why is nt that interest equally compelling before viability? Webster v. Reproductive Health Services Services, 492 U. S. 490, 519 (1989) (plurality opinion) (quoting Thorn burgh , 476 U. S. ,at 795 (White, J. ,dissenting)). Roe did not say, and no explanation is apparent. This arbitrary line has not found much support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted to justify aright to abortion. Some have argued that a fetus should not 51 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court be entitled to legal protection until it acquires the characteristics that they regard as defining what it means to be a person. Among the characteristics that have been offered as essential attributes of personhood are sentience, self awareness, the ability to reason, or some combination thereof. 50 By this logic, it would be an open question whether even born individuals, including young children orthose afflicted with certain developmental or medical conditions, merit protection as persons. But even if one takes the view that personhood begins when a certain attribute or combination of attributes is acquired, it is very hard to see why viability should mark the point where personhood begins. The most obvious problem with any such argument is that viability is heavily dependent on factors that have nothing to do with the characteristics of a fetus. One is the 50See, e. g. ,P. Singer, Rethinking Life Death 218 (1994) (defining a person as a being with awareness of her or his own existence over time, and the capacity to have wants and plans for the future); B. Stein bock, Life Before Birth: The Moral and Legal Status of Embryos and Fetuses 913 (1992) (arguing that the possession of interests is both necessary and sufficient for moral status and that the capacity for conscious awareness is a necessary condition for the possession of interests (em phasis deleted)); M. Wa Warren, On the Moral and Le gal Status of Abortion, 57 The Monist 1, 5 (1973) (arguing that, to qualify as a person, a being must have at least one of five traits that are central to the concept of personhood: (1) consciousness (of objects and events external an dor internal to the being), and in particular the capacity to feel pain; (2) reasoning (the developed capacity to solve new and relatively complex problems); (3) self motivated activity (activity which is relatively independent of either genetic or direct external control); (4) the capacity to communicate, by whatever mean s, messages of an indefinite variety of types; and (5) the presence of self concepts, and self awareness, either individual or racial, or both (emphasis deleted)); M. Too ley, Abortion Infanticide, 2 Philosophy Pub. Affairs 37, 49 (Autumn 1972) (arguing that having a right to life presupposes that one is capable of desiring to continue existing as a subject of experiences and other mental states). 52 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court state of neonatal care at a particular point in time. Due to the development of new equipment and improved practices, the viability line has changed over the years. In the 19th century, a fetus may not have been viable until the 32d or 33d week of pregnancy or even later. 51 When Roe was decided, viability was gauged at roughly 28 weeks. See 410 U. S. ,at 160. Today, respondents draw the line at 23 or 24 weeks. Brief for Respondents 8. So, according to Roes logic, States now have a compelling interest in protecting a fetus with a gestational age of, say, 26 weeks, but in 1973 States did not have an interest in protecting an identical fetus. How can that be? Viability also depends on the quality of the available medical facilities. Colautti v. Franklin Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, 396 (1979). Thus, a 24-week-old fetus may be viable if a woman gives birth in a city with hospitals that provide advanced care for very premature babies, but if the woman travels to a remote area far from any such hospital, the fetus may no longer be viable. On what ground could the constitutional status of a fetus depend on the pregnant womans location? And if viability is meant to mark a line having universal moral significance, can it be that a fetus that is viable in a big city in the United States has a privileged moral status 51See W. Lusk, Science and the Art of Midwifery 7475 (1882) (explain ing that [w]ith care, the life of a child born within [the eighth month of pregnancy] may be preserved); id. ,at 326 (Where the choice lies with the physician, the provocation of labor is usually deferred until thethirtythird or thirty fourth week); J. Beck, Researches in Medicine and Medical Jurisprudence 68 (2d ed. 1835) (Although children born before the completion of the seventh month have occasionally survived, and been reared, yet in a medicolegal point of view, no child ought to be considered as capable of sustaining an independent existence until the seventh month has been fully completed); see also J. Baker, The Incubator and the Medical Discovery of the Pr Premature Infant, J. Perinatology 322 (2000) (explaining that, in the 19th century, infants born at seven to eight months gestation were unlikely to survive beyond the first days of life). 53 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court not enjoyed by an identical fetus in a remote area of a poor country? In addition, as the Court once explained, viability is not really a hardandfast line. Ibid. A physician determining a particular fetuss odds of surviving outside the womb must consider a number of variables, including gestational age, fetal weight, a womans general health and nutrition, the quality of the available medical facilities, and other factors. Id. ,at 395396. It is thus only with difficulty that a physician c an estimate the probability of a particular fetuss survival. Id. ,at 396. And even if each fetuss probability of survival could be ascertained with certainty, settling on a probabilit[y] of survival that should count as viability is another matter. Ibid. Is a fetus viable with a 10 percent chance of survival? 25 percent? 50 percent? Can such a judgment be made by a State? And can a State specify a gestational age limit that applies in all cases? Or must these difficult questions be left entirely to the individual attending physician on the particular facts of the case before him? Id. ,at 388. The viability line, which Ca sey termed Roes central rule, makes no sense, and it is telling that other countries almost uniformly eschew such a line. 52 The Court thus asserted raw judicial power to impose, as a matter of constitutional law, a uniform viability rule that allowed the States less freedom to regulate abortion than the majority of western democracies enjoy. d All in all, Roes reasoning was exceedingly weak, and academic commentators, including those who agreed with the 52According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, only the United States and the Netherlands use viability as a gestational limit on the availability of abortion on request. See Center for Reproductive Rights, The Worlds Abortion Laws (Feb. 23, 2021), https:reproductiverights orgmapsworldsabortionlaws. 54 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court decision as a matter of policy, were unsparing in their criticism. John Hart E ly famously wrote that Roe was not constitutional law and g[ave] almost no sense of an obligation to try to be. E ly 947 (emphasis deleted). Archibald Cox, who served as Solicitor General under President Kennedy, commented that Roe read[s] like a set of hospital rules and regulations that [n]either historian, layman, nor lawyer will be persuaded are part of the Constitution. The Role of the Supreme Court in American Government 113 114 (1976). Laurence Tribe wrote that even if there is a need to divide pregnancy into several segments with lines that clearly identify the limits of governmental power,interestbalancing of the form the Court pursues fails to justify any of the lines actually drawn. Tribe 45. Mark Tush net termed Roe a totally unreasoned judicial opinion. Red, White, and Blue: A Critical Analysis of Constitutional Law 54 (1988). See also P. Bob bitt, Constitutional Fate 157 (1982); A. Amar, Foreword: The Document and the Doctrine, 114 Ha rv. L. Rev. 26, 110 (2000). Despite Roes weaknesses, its reach was steadily extended in the years that followed. The Court struck down laws requiring that second trimester abortions be performed only in hospitals, Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc. Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 433439 (1983); that minors obtain parental consent, Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Dan forth , 428 U. S. 52, 74 (1976); that women give written consent after being informed of the status of the developing prenatal life and the risks of abortion, Akron, 462 U. S. ,at 442445; that women wait 24 hours for an abortion, id. ,at 449451; that a physician determine viability in a particular manner, Colautti , 439 U. S. ,at 390 397; that a physician performing a post viability abortion use the technique most likely to preserve the life of the fe fetus, id. ,at 397401; and that fetal remains be treated in a humane and sanitary manner, Akron, 462 U. S. ,at 451 452. 55 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court Justice White complained that the Court was engaging in unrestrained imposition of its own extraconstitutional value preferences. Thorn burgh , 476 U. S. ,at 794 (dissenting opinion). And the United States as am icus curiae asked the Court to overrule Roe five times in the decade before Ca sey ,see 505 U. S. ,at 844 (joint opinion), and then asked the Court to overrule it once more in Ca sey itself. 2 When Ca sey revisited Roe almost 20 years later, very little of Roes reasoning was defended or preserved. The Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause. 505 U. S. ,at 846. The Court did not reaffirm Roes erroneous account of abortion history. In fact, none of the Justices in the majority said anything about the history of the abortion right. And as for precedent, the Court relied on essentially the same body of cases that Roe had cited. Thus, with respect to the standard grounds for constitutional de cisionmakingtext, history, and precedent Ca sey did not attempt to bolster Roes rea reasoning. The Court also made no real effort to remedy one of the greatest weaknesses in Roes analysis: its much criticized discussion of viability. The Court retained what it called Roes central holding that a State may not regulate previability abortions for the purpose of protecting fetal life but it provided no principled defense of the viability line. 505 U. S. ,at 860, 870871. Instead, it merely rephrased what Roe had said, stating that viability marked the point at which the independent existence of a second life can in reason and fairness be the object of state protection that now overrides the rights of the woman. 505 U. S. ,at 870. Why reason and fairness demanded that the line be drawn at viability the Court did not explain. And the Justices who authored the controlling opinion conspicuously 56 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court failed to say that they agreed with the viability rule; instead, they candidly acknowledged the reservations [some] of us may have in reaffirming [that] holding of Roe. Id. ,at 853. The controlling opinion criticized and rejected Roes trimester scheme, 505 U. S. ,at 872, and substituted a new undue burden test, but the basis for this test was obscure. And as we will explain, the test is full of ambiguities and is difficult to apply. Ca sey ,in short, either refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roes analysis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roes reasoning, endorsed what it termed Roes central holding while suggesting that a majority might not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the abortion right other than Roes status as precedent, and imposed a new and prob problematic test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent. As discussed below, Ca sey also deployed a novel version of the doctrine of stare dec isis See infra ,at 6469. This new doctrine did not account fo r the profound wrongness of the decision in Roe, and placed great weight on an intangible form of reliance with little if any basis in prior case law. Stare dec isis does not command the preservation of such a decision. C Workability Our precedents counsel that another important consideration in deciding whether a precedent should be overruled is whether the rule it imposes is workable that is, whether it can be understood and applied in a consistent and predictable manner. Monte jo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 792 (2009); Patter son v. M cLean Credit Un ion, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989); Gulf Corp., 485 U. S. 271, 283284 (1988). Case ys undue burden test has scored poorly on the workability scale. 57 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court 1 Problems begin with the very concept of an undue burden. As Justice Scalia noted in his Ca sey partial dissent, determining whether a burden is due or undue is inherently standard less. 505 U. S. ,at 992; see also June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Rus so , S., (2020) (GOR SUCH ,J. ,dissenting) (slip o p. ,at 17) ([W]hether a burden is deemed undue depends heavily on which factors the judge considers and how much weight he accords each of them (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). The Ca sey plurality tried to put meaning into the undue burden test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these rules created their own problems. The first rule is that a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability. 505 U. S. ,at 878 (emphasis added); see also id ,.at 877. But whether a particular obstacle qualifies as substantial is often open to reasonable debate. In the sense relevant here, substantial means of ample or considerable amount, quantity, or size. Random House Websters Unabridged Dictionary 1897 (2d ed. 2001). Huge burdens are plainly substantial ,and trivial ones are not, but in between these extremes, there is a wide gray area. This ambiguity is a problem, and the second rule, which applies at all stages of a pregnancy, muddies things further. It states that measures designed to ensure that the womans choice is informed are constitutional so long as they do not impose an undue burden on the right. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 878. To the extent that this rule applies to previability abortions, it overlaps with the first rule and appears to impose a different standard. Consider a law that imposes an insubstantial obstacle but serves little purpose. As applied to a previability abortion, would such a regulation be constitutional on the ground that it does not impose a substantial obstacle? Or would it be unconstitutional on 58 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court the ground that it creates an undue burden because the burden it imposes, though slight, outweighs its negligible benefits? Ca sey does not say, and this ambiguity would lead to confusion down the line. Compare June Medical Medical, 591 U. S. ,at (plurality opinion) (slip o p. ,at 12), with id. ,at (R (ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring) (slip o p. ,at 5 6). The third rule complicates the picture even more. Under that rule, [u]nnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 878 (emphasis added). This rule contains no fewer than three vague terms. It includes the two already discussed undue burden and substantialobstacleeven though they ar e inconsistent. And it adds a third ambiguous term when it refers to unnecessary health regulations. The term necessary has a range of meanings from essential to merely useful. See Blacks Law Dictionary 928 (5th ed. 1979); American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 877 (1971). Ca sey did not explain the sense in which the term is used in this rule. In addition to these problems, one more applies to all three rules. They all call on courts to examine a laws effect on women, but a regulation may have a very different impact on different women for a va variety of reasons, including their places of residence, financial resources, family situations, work and personal obligations, knowledge about fetal development and abortion, psychological and emotional disposition and condition, and the firmness of their desire to obtain abortions. In order to determine whether a regulation presents a substantial obstacle to women, a court needs to know which set of women it should have in mind and how many of the women in this set must find that an obstacle is substantial. Ca sey provided no clear answer to these questions. It said that a regulation is unconstitutional if it imposes a 59 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court substantial obstacle in a large fraction of cases in which [it] is relevant, 505 U. S. ,at 895, but there is obviously no clear line between a fraction that is large and one that is not. Nor is it clear what the Court meant by cases in which a regulation is relevant. These ambiguities have caused confusion and disagreement. Compare Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. 582, 627628 (2016), with id. ,at 666667, and n. 11 (A LI TO, J. ,dissenting). 2 The difficulty of applying Ca sey s new rules surfaced in that very case. The controlling opinion found that Pennsylvanias 24-hour waiting period requirement and its informed consent provision did not impose undue burden[s], Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 881887, but Justice Stevens, applying the same test, reached the opposite result, id. ,at 920922 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). That did not bode well, and then Chief Justice Rehnquist aptly observed that the undue burden standard presents nothing more workable than the trimester framework. Id. ,at 964966 (dissenting opinion). The ambiguity of the undue burden test also produced disagreement in later cases. In Whole Womans Health ,the Court adopted the cost benefit interpretation of the test, stating that [t]he rule announced in Ca sey requires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer confer. 579 U. S. ,at 607 (emphasis added). But five years later, a majority of the Justices rejected that interpretation. See June Medical, 591 U. S. Four Justices reaffirmed Whole Womans Health s instruction to weigh a laws benefits against the burdens it imposes on abortion access. 591 U. S. ,at (plurality opinion) (s lip o p. ,at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted). But T HE CHIEF JUSTICE who cast 60 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court the deciding vote argued that [n]othing about Ca sey suggested that a weighing of costs and benefits of an abortion regulation was a job for the courts. Id. ,at (opinion con concurring in judgment) (slip o p. ,at 6). And the four Justices in dissent rejected the pluralitys interpretation of Ca sey See 591 U.

This Courts experience applying Ca sey has confirmed Chief Justice Rehnquists prescient diagnosis that the undue burden standard was not built to last. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 965 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). 3 The experience of the Courts of Appeals provides further evidence that Ca sey s line between permissible and unconstitutional restrictions has proved to be impossible to draw with precision. Janus Janus, 585 U. S. ,at (slip o p. ,at 38). Ca sey has generated a long list of Circuit conflicts. Most recently, the Courts of Appeals have disagreed about whether the balancing test from Whole Womans Health correctly states the undue burden framework. 53 They have disagreed on the legality of parental notification rules. 54 53Compare Whole Womans Health v.

S. ,at (opinion of K AVANAUGH ,J. )(slip o p. ,at 15); Janus Janus, 585 U. S. ,at (slip o p. ,at 34 35). 1 Traditional reliance interests arise where advance planning of great precision is most obviously a necessity. Ca sey, 505 U. S. ,at 856 (joint opinion); see also Pay ne , 501 U. S. ,at 828. In Ca sey ,the controlling opinion conceded that those traditional reliance interests were not implicated because getting an abortion is generally unplanned activity, and reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions. 505 U. S. ,at 856. For these reasons, we agree with the Ca sey plurality that conventional, concrete reliance interests are not present here. 2 Unable to find reliance in the conventional sense, the controlling opinion in Ca sey perceived a more intangible form of reliance. It wrote that people [had] organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail and that [t]he ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. Ibid. But this Court is ill equipped to assess generalized assertions about the national psyche. Id. ,at 957 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J. J.). Ca sey s notion of reliance thus finds little support in our cases, which instead emphasize very concrete reliance interests, like those that develop in cases involving property and contract rights. Pay ne , 501 U. S. ,at 828. When a concrete reliance interest is asserted, courts are equipped to evaluate the claim, but assessing the novel and 65 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court intangible form of reliance endorsed by the Ca sey plurality is another matter. That form of reliance depends on an empirical question that is hard for anyone and in particular, for a court to assess, namely, the effect of the abortion right on society and in particular on the lives of women. The contending sides in this case make impassioned and conflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right on the lives of women. Compare Brief for Petitioners 3436; Brief for Women Scholars e t al. as Ami ci Curiae 1320, 2941, with Brief for Respondents 3641; Brief for National Womens Law Center e t al. as Ami ci Curiae 1532. The contending sides also make conflicting arguments about the status of the fetus. This Court has neither the authority nor the expertise to adjudicate those disputes, and the Ca sey pluralitys speculations and weighing of the relative importance of the fetus and mother represent a departure from the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies. Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 729730 (1963). Our decision returns the issue of abortion to those legislative bodies, and it allows women on both sides of the abortion issue to seek to affect the legislative process by influencing public opinion, lobbying legislators, voting, and running for office. Women are not without electoral or political power. It is noteworthy that the percentage of women who register to vote and cast ballots is consistently higher than the percentage of men who do so. 66 In the last election in November 2020, women, who make up around51. 5 percent of the population of Mississippi, 67 constituted 66See De pt. of Commerce, U. S. Census Bureau (Census Bureau), An Analysis of the 2018 Congressional Election 6 (Dec. 2021) (Fig. 5) (showing that women made up over 50 percent of the voting population in every congressional election between 1978 and 2018). 67Census Bureau, Quick Facts, Mississippi (July 1, 2021), https :www. 66 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court 55. 5 percent of the voters who cast ballots. 68 3 Unable to show concrete reliance on Roe and Ca sey them selves, the Solicitor General suggests that overruling those decisions would threaten the Courts precedents holding that the Due Process Clause protects other rights. Brief for United States 26 (citing Obergefell , 576 U. S. 644; Lawrence Lawrence, 539 U. S. 558; Gris wold, 381 U. S. 479). That is not correct for reasons we have already discussed. As even the Ca sey plurality recognized, [a]bortion is a unique act because it terminates life or potential life. 505 U. S. ,at 852; see also Roe Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 159 (abortion is inherently different from marital intimacy, marriage, or procreation). And to ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mis characterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. IV Having shown that traditional stare dec isis factors do not weigh in favor of retaining Roe or Ca sey ,we must address one final argument that featured prominently in the Ca sey plurality opinion. The argument was cast in different terms, but stated simply, it was essentially as follows. The American peoples belief in the rule of law would be shaken if they lost respect for this Court as an institution that decides important cases based on principle, not social and political pressures. 505 U. S. ,at 865 There is a special danger that the public will census. govquickfactsMS. 68Census Bureau, Voting and Registration in the Election of November 2020, Table 4b: Reported Voting and Registration, by Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin, for States: November 2020, https :www. census. govdata tablestime-seriesdemovoting-and-registrationp20-585. html. 67 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court perceive a decision as having been made for unprincipled reasons when the Court overrules a controversial water shed decision, such as Roe. 505 U. S. ,at 866867. A decision overruling Roe would be perceived as having been made under fire and as a surrender to political pressure, 505 U. S. ,at 867, and therefore the preservation of public approval of the Court weighs heavily in favor of retaining Roe, see 505 U. S. ,at 869. This analysis starts out on the right foot but ultimately veers off course. The Ca sey plurality was certainly right that it is important for the public to perceive that our decisions are based on principle, and we should make every effort to achieve that objective by issuing opinions that care fully show how a proper understanding of the law leads to the results we reach. But we cannot exceed the scope of our authority under the Constitution, and we cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the publics reaction to our work. Cf. Texas v. Johnson Johnson, 491 U. S. 397 (1989); Brown Brown, 347 U. S. 483. That is true both when we initially decide a constitutional issue and when we consider whether to overrule a prior decision. As Chief Justice Rehnquist explained, The Judicial Branch derives its legitimacy, not from following public opinion, but from deciding by its best lights whether legislative enactments of the popular branches of Government comport with the Constitution. The doctrine of stare dec isis is an adjunct of this duty, and should be no more subject to the vagaries of public opinion than is the basic judicial task. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 963 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). In suggesting otherwise, the Ca sey plurality went beyond this Courts role in our constitutional system. The Ca sey plurality call[ed] the contending sides of a national controversy to end th their national division, and claimed the authority to impose a permanent settlement of the issue of a constitutional abortion right simply by saying 68 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court that the matter was closed. Id. ,at 867. That unprecedented claim exceeded the power vested in us by the Constitution. As Alexander Hamilton famously put it, the Con Constitution gives the judiciary neither Force nor Will. The Federalist No. 78, p. 523 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Our sole authority is to exercise judgment which is to say, the authority to judge what the law means and how it should apply to the case at hand. Ibid. The Court has no authority to decree that an erroneous precedent is permanently exempt from evaluation under traditional stare dec isis principles. A precedent of this Court is subject to the usual principles of stare dec isis under which adherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command. If the rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy and Lochner would still be the law. That is not how stare dec isis operates. The Ca sey plurality also misjudged the practical limits of this Courts influence. Roe certainly did not succeed in end ing division on the issue of abortion. On the contrary, Roe inflamed a national issue that has remained bitterly divisive for the past half century. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 995 (opinion of Scalia, J. );see also R. Gins burg, Speaking in a Judicial Voice, 67 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1185, 1208 (1992) (Roe may have halted a political process, prolonged divisiveness, and deferred stable settlement of the issue). And for the past 30 years, Ca sey has done the same. Neither decision has ended debate over the issue of a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Indeed, in this case, 26 States expressly ask us to overrule Roe and Ca sey and to return the issue of abortion to the people and their elected representatives. This Courts inability to end debate on the issue should not have been surprising. This Court cannot bring about the permanent resolution of a rancorous national controversy simply by dictating a settlement and telling the people to move on. Whatever influence the Court may have on public attitudes must stem from the 69 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court strength of our opinions, not an attempt to exercise raw judicial power. Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 222 (White, J. ,dissenting). We do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to todays decision overruling Roe and Ca sey And even if we could foresee what will happen, we would have no authority to let that knowledge influence our decision. We can only do our job, which is to interpret the law, apply longstanding principles of stare dec isis ,and decide this case accordingly. We therefore hold that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. Roe and Ca sey must be overruled, and the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives. V A 1 The dissent argues that we have abandon[ed] stare dec isis, post, at 30, but we have done no such thing, and it is the dissents understanding of stare dec isis that breaks with tradition. The dissents foundational contention is that the Court should never (or perhaps almost never) overrule an egregiously constitutional precedent unless the Court can poin[t] to major legal or factual changes undermining [the] decisions original basis. Post, at 37. To support this contention, the dissent claims that Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, and other landmark cases overruling prior precedents responded to changed law and to changed facts and attitudes that had taken hold throughout society. Post, at 43. The unmistakable implication of this argument is that only the passage of time and new developments justified those decisions. Recognition that the cases they overruled were egregiously wrong on the day they were handed down was not enough. The Court has never adopted this strange new version of 70 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court stare dec isis and with good reason. Does the dissent really maintain that overruling Plessy was not justified until the country had experienced more than a half century of state sanctioned segregation and generations of Black school children had suffered all its effects? Post, at 4445. Here is another example. On the dissents view, it must have been wrong for West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette , 319 U. S. 624, to overrule Miners ville School D ist. v Go bitis, 310 U. S. 586, a bare three years after it was handed down. In both cases, children who were Jehovahs Witnesses refused on religious grounds to salute the flag or recite the pledge of allegiance. The Barnette Court did not claim that its reexamination of the issue was prompted by any intervening legal or factual developments, so if the Court had followed the dissents new version of stare de ci sis, it would have been compelled to adhere to Go bitis and countenance continued First Amendment violations for some unspecified period. Precedents should be respected, but sometimes the Court errs, and occasionally the Court issues an important decision that is egregiously wrong. When that happens, stare dec isis is not a straitjacket. And indeed, the dissent eventually admits that a decision could be overruled just because it is terribly wrong, though the dissent does not ex plain when that would be so. Post ,at 45. 2 Even if the dissent were correct in arguing that an egregiously wrong decision should (almost) never be overruled unless its mistake is later highlighted by major legal or factual changes, reexamination of Roe and Ca sey would be amply justified. We have already mentioned a number of postCasey developments, see supra, at 3334, 5963, but the most profound change may be the failure of the Ca sey pluralitys call for the contending sides in the controversy about abortion to end their national division, 505 U. S. ,at 71 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court 867. That has not happened, and there is no reason to think that another decision sticking with Roe would achieve what Ca sey could not. The dissent, however, is undeterred. It contends that the very controversy surrounding Roe and Ca sey is an important stare dec isis consideration that requires upholding those precedents. See post, at 5557. The dissent characterizes Ca sey as a precedent about precedent that is permanently shielded from further evaluation under traditional stare dec isis principles. See post, at 57. But as we have explained, Ca sey broke new ground when it treated the national controversy provoked by Roe as a ground for refusing to reconsider that decision, and no subsequent case has relied on that factor. Our decision today simply applies longstanding stare dec isis factors instead of applying a version of the doctrine that seems to apply only in abortion cases. 3 Finally, the dissent suggests that our decision calls into question Gris wold, Eisenstadt ,Lawrence, and Obergefell. Post, at 45, 2627, n. 8. But we have stated unequivocally that [n]othing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. Supra, at 66. We have also explained why that is so: rights regard ing contraception and same sex relationships are inherently different from the right to abortion because the latter (as we have stressed) uniquely involves what Roe and Ca sey termed potential life. Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 150 (emphasis deleted); Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 852. Therefore, a right to abortion cannot be justified by a purported analogy to the rights recognized in those other cases or by appeals to a broader right to autonomy. Supra, at 32. It is hard to see how we could be clearer. Moreover, even putting aside that these cases are distinguishable, there is a further point that the dissent ignores: Each precedent is subject to its own stare 72 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court dec isis analysis, and the factors that our doctrine instructs us to consider like reliance and workability are different for these cases than for our abortion jurisprudence. B 1 We now turn to the concurrence in the judgment, which reproves us for deciding whether Roe and Ca sey should be retained or overruled. That opinion (which for convenience we will call simply the concurrence) recommends a more measured course, which it ROBERTS ,C. J. ).The concurrence would leave for another day whether to re reject any right to an abortion at all, post, at 7, and would hold only that if the Constitution protects any such right, the right ends once women have had a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion, post, at 1. The concurrence does not specify what period of time is sufficient to provide such an opportunity, but it would hold that 15 weeks, the period allowed under Mississippis law, is enough at least absent rare circumstances. Post, at 2, 10. There are serious problems with this approach, and it is revealing that nothing like it was recommended by either party. As we have recounted, both parties and the Solicitor General have urged us either to reaffirm or overrule Roe and Ca sey See supra, at 45. And when the specific approach advanced by the concurrence was broached at oral argument, both respondents and the Solicitor General emphatically rejected it. Respondents counsel termed it completely unworkable and less principled and less workable than viability. T r. of Oral A rg. 54. The Solicitor General argued that abandoning the viability line would leave courts and other s with no continued guidance. Id. ,at 101. What is more, the concurrence has not identified any of the 73 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court more than 130 am icus briefs filed in this case that advocated its approach. The concurrence would do exactly what it criticizes Roe for doing: pulling out of thin air a test that [n]o party or am icus asked the Court to adopt. Post, at 3. 2 The concurrences most fundamental defect is its failure to offer any principled basis for its approach. The concurrence would discar[d] the rule from Roe and Ca sey that a womans right to terminate her pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is regarded as viable outside the womb. Post, at 2. But this rule was a critical component of the holdings in Roe and Ca sey ,and stare dec isis is a doc trine of preservation, not transformation, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commn, (ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring). Therefore, a new rule that discards the viability rule cannot be defended on stare dec isis grounds. The concurrence concedes that its approach would not be available if the rationale of Roe and Ca sey were inextricably entangled with and dependent upon the viability standard. Post, at 7. But the concurrence asserts that the via viability line is separable from the constitutional right they recognized, and can therefore be discarded without disturbing any past precedent. Post, at 78. That is simply incorrect. Roes trimester rule was expressly tied to viability, see 410 U. S. ,at 163164, and viability played a critical role in later abortion decisions. For example, in Planned Parenthood of Central Mo v. Dan forth , 428 U. S. 52, the Court reiterated Roes rule that a State may regulate an abortion to protect the life of the fetus and even may pro scribe abortion at the stage subsequent to viability. 428 U. S. ,at 61 (emphasis added). The Court then rejected a challenge to Missouris definition of viability, holding that the States definition was consistent with Roes. 428 U. S. ,74 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court at 6364. If viability was not an essential part of the rule adopted in Roe, the Court would have had no need to make that comparison. The holding in Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, is even more instructive. In that ca se, the Court noted that prior cases had stressed viability and reiterated that [v]iability is the critical point under Roe. 439 U. S. ,at 388389. It then struck down Pennsylvanias definition of viability, id. ,at 389394, and it is hard to see how the Court could have done that if Roes discussion of viability was not part of its holding. When the Court reconsidered Roe in Ca sey ,it left no doubt about the importance of the viability rule. It described the rule as Roes central holding, 505 U. S. ,at 860, and repeatedly stated that the right it reaffirmed was the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before vi ability .Id. ,at 846 (emphasis added). See id. ,at 871 (The womans right to terminate her pregnancy before viability is the most central principle of Roe v. Wade It is a rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce (emphasis added)); id ,.at 872 (A woman has a right to choose to terminate or continue her pregnancy before viability (emphasis added)); id. ,at 879 ([A] State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability (emphasis added)). Our subsequent cases have continued to recognize the centrality of the viability rule. See Whole Womens Health Health, 579 U. S. ,at 589590 ([A] provision of law is constitutionally invalid, if the purpose or effect of the provision is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability (emphasis deleted and added)); id. ,at 627 ([W]e now use viability as the relevant point at which a State may begin limiting womens access to abortion for reasons unrelated to maternal health (emphasis added)). 75 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court Not only is the new rule proposed by the concurrence inconsistent with Ca sey s unambiguous language, post, at 8, it is also contrary to the judgment in that case and later abortion cases. In Ca sey ,the Court held that Pennsylvanias spousal notification provision was facially unconstitutional, not just that it was unconstitutional as applied to abortions sought prior to the time when a woman has had a reasonable opportunity to choose. See 505 U. S. ,at 887 898. The same is true of Whole Womens Health ,which held that certain rules that required physicians performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital were facially unconstitutional because they placed a sub substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previability abortion abortion. 579 U. S. ,at 591 (emphasis added). For all these reasons, stare dec isis cannot justify the new reasonable opportunity rule propounded by the concurrence. If that rule is to become the law of the land, it must stand on its own, but the concurrence makes no attempt to show that this rule represents a correct interpretation of the Constitution. The concurrence does not claim that the right to a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion is deeply rooted in this Nations history and tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. Glucks berg , 521 U. S. ,at 720721. Nor does it propound any other theory that could show that the Constitution supports its new rule. And if the Constitution protects a womans right to obtain an abortion, the opinion does not explain why that right should end after the point at which all reasonable women will have decided whether to seek an abortion. While the concurrence is moved by a desire for judicial minimalism, we cannot embrace a narrow ground of decision simply because it is narrow; it must also be right. Citizens United United, 558 U. S. ,at 375 (R (ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring). For the reasons that we have explained, the concurrences approach is not. 76 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court 3 The concurrence would leave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion at all, post, at 7, but another day would not be long in coming. Some States have set deadlines for obtaining an abortion that are shorter than Mississippis. See, e. g. ,Memphis Center for Reproductive Health v. Slater y ,14 F. 4th, at 414 (considering law with bans at cascading intervals of two to three weeks beginning at six weeks), re hg en banc granted, 14 F. 4th 550 (CA6 2021). If we held only that Mississippis 15-week ru leis constitutional, we would soon be called upon to pass on the constitutionality of a panoply of laws with shorter deadlines or no deadline at all. The measured course charted by the concurrence would be fraught with turmoil until the Court answered the question that the concurrence seeks to defer. Even if the Court ultimately adopted the new rule suggested by the concurrence, we would be faced with the difficult problem of spelling out what it means. For example, if the period required to gi give women a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion were pegged, as the concur concurrence seems to suggest, at the point when a certain percentage of women make that choice, see post, at 12, 910, we would have to identify the relevant percentage. It would also be necessary to explain what the concurrence means when it refers to rare circumstances that might justify an exception. Post, at 10. And if this new right aims to give women a reasonable opportunity to get an abortion, it would be necessary to decide whether factors other than promptness in deciding might have a bearing on whether such an opportunity was available. In sum, the concurrences quest for a middle way would only put off the day when we wo would be forced to confront the question we now decide. The turmoil wrought by Roe and Ca sey would be prolonged. It is far better for this Court 77 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Opinion of the Court and the country to face up to the real issue without fur further delay. VI We must now decide what standard will govern if state abortion regulations undergo constitutional challenge and whether the law before us satisfies the appropriate standard. A Under our precedents, rational basis review is the appropriate standard for such challenges. As we have explained, procuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional right because such a right has no basis in the Constitutions text or in our Nations history. See supra, at 839. It follows that the States may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are challenged under the Constitution, courts cannot substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies. Ferguson , 372 U. S. ,at 729730; see also Dand ridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471, 484486 (1970); United States v. Carol ene Products Co. Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152 (1938). That respect for a legislatures judgment applies even when the laws at issue concern matters of great social significance and moral substance. See, e. g. ,Board of Trustees of Un iv. of Ala. v. Garret t , 531 U. S. 356, 365368 (2001) (treatment of the disabled); Glucks berg , 521 U. S. ,at 728 (assisted suicide); San Antonio Independent School D ist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 3235, 55 (1973) (financing public education). A law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is entitled to a strong presumption of validity. Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319 (1993). It must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests. Id. ,at 320; FCC v. Beach Communications ,Inc. Inc., 508 U. S. 78 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court 307, 313 (1993); New Orleans v. Dukes Dukes, 427 U. S. 297, 303 (1976) (per curia m ); Williams on v. Lee Optical of Ok la. ,Inc. Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 491 (1955). These legitimate interests in include respect for and preservation of prenatal life at all stages of development, Gonzales, 550 U. S. ,at 157158; the protection of maternal health and safety; the elimination of particularly gruesome or barbaric medical procedures; the preservation of the integrity of the medical profession; the mitigation of fetal pain; and the prevention of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or disability. See id. ,at 156 157; Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 150; cf. Glucks berg, 521 U. S. ,at 728 731 (identifying similar interests). B These legitimate interests justify Mississippis Gestational Age Act. Except in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality, the statute prohibits abortion if the probable gestational age of the unborn human being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15) weeks. Miss. Code Ann. 4141191(4)(b). The Mississippi Legislatures findings recount the stages of human prenatal development and assert the States interest in protecting the life of the unborn. 2(b)(i). The legislature also found that abortions performed after 15 weeks typically use the dilation and ev acuation procedure, and the legislature found the use of th is procedure for nontherapeutic or elective reasons [to be] a barbaric practice, dan dangerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the medical profession. 2(b)(i)(8); see also Gonzales, 550 U. S. ,at 135143 (describing such procedures). These legitimate interests provide a rational basis for the Gestational Age Act, and it follows that respondents constitutional challenge must fail. VII We end this opinion where we began. Abortion presents Opinion of the Court 79 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) Appendix A to opinion of the Court a profound moral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibit ing abortion. Roe and Ca sey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives. The judgment of the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION, ETALON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT [June 24, 2022] JUSTICE THOMAS ,concurring. I join the opinion of the Co Court because it correctly holds that there is no constitutional right to abortion. Respondents invoke one source for that right: the Fourteenth Amendments guarantee that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The Court well explains why, under our substantive due process precedents, the purported right to abortion is not a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. Such a right is neither deeply rooted in this Nations history and tradition nor implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. Washington v. Glucks berg , 521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). [T]he idea that the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment understood the Due Process Clause to protect a ri right to abortion is farcical. June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Rus so , 591 U. S. S., (2020) (T (THOMAS ,J. ,dissenting) (slip o p. ,at 17). I write separately to emphasize a second, more fundamental reason why there is no abortion guarantee lurking in the Due Process Clause. Considerable historical evidence indicates that due process of law merely required executive and judicial actors to comply with legislative enactments and the common law when depriving a person of 2 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION THOMAS ,J. ,concurring life, liberty, or property. See, e. g. ,Johnson v. United States States, 576 U. S. 591, 623 (2015) (T (THOMAS ,J. ,concurring in judgment). Other sources, by contrast, suggest that due process of law prohibited legislatures from authorizing the deprivation of a persons life, liberty, or property without providing him the customary procedures to which freemen were entitled by the old law of England. United States v. Vaello Made ro , 596 U. S. S., (2022) (T (THOMAS ,J. ,concurring) (slip o p. ,at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted). Either way, the Due Process Clause at most guarantees process It does not, as the Courts substantive due process cases suppose, forbi[d] the gove government to infringe certain fundamental liberty interests at all ,no matter what process is provided. Reno v. Flores Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993); see also, e. g. ,Collins v. Hark er Heights Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992). As I have previously explained, substantive due process is an oxymoron that lack[s] any basis in the Constitution. Johnson Johnson, 576 U. S. ,at 607608 (opinion of T THOMAS ,J. );see also, e. g. g., Vaello Made ro , 596 U. S. ,at (T (THOMAS ,J. ,con concurring) (slip o p. ,at 3) ([T]ext and history provide little support for modern substantive due process doctrine). The notion that a constitutional provision that guarantees only process before a person is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define the substance of those rights strains credulity for even the most casual user of words. McDonald v. Chicago Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 811 (2010) (T (THOMAS ,J. ,concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also United States v. Carl ton , 512 U. S. 26, 40 (1994) (Scalia, J. ,concurring in judgment). The resolution of this case is thus straightforward. Because the Due Process Clause does not secure any substantive rights, it does not secure a right to abortion. The Court today declines to disturb substantive due process jurisprudence generally or the doctrines application i nother, specific contexts. Cases like Gris wold v. Connecticut ,3 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) THOMAS ,J. ,concurring 381 U. S. 479 (1965) (right of married persons to obtain contraceptives); Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003) (right to engage in private, consensual sexual acts); and Obergefell v. Hod ges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015) (right to same sex marriage), are not at issue. The Courts abortion cases are unique, see ante, at 3132, 66, 7172, and no party has asked us to decide whether our entire Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence must be preserved or revised, Mc Don al d, 561 U. S. ,at 813 (opinion of T THOMAS ,J. ).Thus, I agree that [n]othing in [the Courts] opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. Ante, at 66. For that reason, in future ca ses, we should reconsider all of this Courts substantive due process precedents, including Gris wold ,Lawrence ,and Obergefell. Because any sub substantive due process decision is demonstrably erroneous, R amos v. Louisiana Louisiana, 590 U. S. S., (2020) (T (THOMAS ,J. ,concurring in judgment) (slip o p. ,at 7), we have a duty to correct the error established in those precedents, Gamble v. United States States, 587 U. S. S., (2019) (T (THOMAS ,J. ,concurring) (slip o p. ,at 9). After overruling these demonstrably erroneous decisions, the question would remain whether other constitutional provisions guarantee the myriad rights that our substantive due process cases have generated. For example, we could consider whether any of the rights announced in this Courts substantive due process cases are privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Amd t. Gris wold v. Connecticut purported not to rely on the Due Process Clause, but rather reasoned that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights including rights enumerated in the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendment shave penumbras, formed by emanations, that create zones of privacy. 381 U. S. ,at 484. Since Gris wold, the Court, perhaps recognizing the facial absurdity of Gris wolds penumbral argument, has characterized the decision as one rooted in substantive due process. See, e. g. g., Obergefell v. Hod ges, 576 U. S. 644, 663 (2015); Washington v. Glucks berg, 521 U. S. 702, 720 (1997). 4 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION THOMAS ,J. ,concurring 14, 1; see McDonald, 561 U. S. ,at 806 (opinion of T THOMAS ,J. ).To answer that question, we would need to decide important antecedent questions, including whether the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects any rights that are not enumerated in the Constitution and, if so, how to identify those rights. See id. ,at 854. That said, even if the Clause does protect unenumerated rights, the Court conclusively demonstrates that abortion is not one of them under any plausible interpretive approach. See ante, at 15, n. 22. Moreover, apart from being a demonstrably incorrect reading of the Due Process Clause, the legal fiction of substantive due process is particularly dangerous. McDonald, 561 U. S. ,at 811 (opinion of T THOMAS ,J. );accord, Obergefell, 576 U. S. ,at 722 (T (THOMAS ,J. ,dissenting). At least three dangers favor jettisoning the doctrine entirely. First, substantive due process exalts judges at the expense of the People from whom they derive their authority. Ibid. Because the Due Process Clause speaks only to process, the Court has long struggled to define what substantive rights it protects. Ti mbs v. Indiana Indiana, 586 U. S. S., (2019) (T (THOMAS ,J. ,concurring in judgment) (slip o p. ,at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted). In practice, the Courts approach for identifying those fundamental rights unquestionably involves policy making rather than neutral legal analysis. Carl ton , 512 U. S. ,at 4142 (opinion of Scalia, J. );see also McDonald, 561 U. S. ,at 812 (opinion of T THOMAS ,J. )(substantive due process is a jurisprudence devoid of a guiding principle). The Court divines new rights in line with its own, extraconstitutional value preferences and nullifies state laws that do not align with the judicially created guarantees. Thorn burgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 794 (1986) (White, J. ,dissenting). Nowhere is this exaltation of judicial policy making clearer than this Courts abortion jurisprudence. In Roe v. Wade Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), the Court divined a right to 5 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) THOMAS ,J. ,concurring abortion because it fe[lt] that the Fourteenth Amendments concept of personal liberty included a right of privacy that is broad enough to encompass a womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. Id. ,at 153. In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Ca sey , 505 U. S. 833 (1992), the Court likewise identified an abortion guarantee in the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, but, rather than a right of privacy, it in invoked an ethereal right to define ones own concept of ex existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Id. ,at 851. As the Courts preferred manifestation of liberty changed, so, too, did the test used to protect it, as Roe s author lamented. See Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 930 (Black mun, J. ,concurring in part and dissenting in part) ([T]he Roe framework is far more administrable, and far less manipulable, than the undue burden standard). Now, in this case, the nature of the purported liberty supporting the abortion right has shifted yet again. Re Respondents and the United States propose no fewer than three different interests that supposedly spring from the Due Process Clause. They include bodily integrity, per personal autonomy in matters of family, medical care, and faith, Brief for Respondents 21, and womens equal citizenship, Brief for United States as Am icus Curiae 24. That 50 years have passed since Roe and abortion advocates still cannot coherently articulate th e right (or rights) at stake proves the obvious: The right to abortion is ultimately a policy goal in desperate search of a constitutional justification. Second, substantive due process distorts other areas of constitutional law. For example, once this Court identifies a fundamental right for one class of individuals, it invokes the Equal Protection Clause to demand exacting scrutiny of statutes that deny the right to other s. See, e. g. g., Eisenstadt v. Baird , 405 U. S. 438, 453454 (1972) (relying on Gris wold to invalidate a state statute prohibiting distribution 6 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION THOMAS ,J. ,concurring of contraceptives to unmarried persons). Statutory classifications implicating certain nonfundamental rights, meanwhile, receive only cursory review. See, e. g. ,Armour v. Indianapolis Indianapolis, 566 U. S. 673, 680 (2012). Similarly, this Court deems unconstitutionally vague or over broad those laws that impinge on its preferred rights, while letting slide those laws that implicate supposedly lesser values. See, e. g. ,Johnson Johnson, 576 U. S. ,at 618621 (opinion of T THOMAS ,J. );United States v. SinenengSmith , 590 U. S. S., (2020) (T (THOMAS ,J. ,concurring) (slip o p. ,at 35). In fact, our vagueness doctrine served as the basis for the first draft of the majority opinion in Roe v. Wade ,and it since has been deployed to nullify even mild regulations of the abortion industry. Johnson, 576 U. S. ,at 620621 (opinion of T THOMAS ,J. ).Therefore, regardless of the doctrinal con text, the Court often demand[s] extra justifications for encroachments on preferred ri rights while relax[ing] purportedly higher standards of review for less preferred rights. Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt , 579 U. S. 582, 640642 (2016) (T (THOMAS ,J. ,dissenting). Substantive due process is the core inspiration for many of the Courts constitutionally unmoored policy judgments. Third, substantive due process is often wielded to disastrous ends. Gamble Gamble, 587 U. S. ,at (T (THOMAS ,J. ,concurring) (slip o p. ,at 16). For instance, in D red Scott v. Sand ford, 19 How. 393 (1857), the Court invoked a species of substantive due process to announce that Congress was powerless to emancipate slaves brought into the federal territories. See id. ,at 452. While D red Scott was overruled on the battlefields of the Civil War and by constitutional amendment after Appomattox, Obergefell, 576 U. S. ,at 696 (R (ROBERTS ,C. J. ,dissenting), that overruling was [p]urchased at the price of immeasurable human suffering, Ada rand Constructors, Inc. v. Pea Pea, 515 U. S. 200, 240 (1995) (T (THOMAS ,J. ,concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Now today, the Court rightly overrules Roe and 7 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) THOMAS ,J. ,concurring Ca sey two of this Courts mos t notoriously incorrect substantive due process decisions, Ti mbs , 586 U. S. ,at (opinion of T THOMAS ,J. )(slip o p. ,at 2)after more than 63 million abortions have been performed, see National Right to Life Committee, Abortion Statistics (Jan. 2022), https :www. nrl c. orguploadsfactsheetsFS01AbortionintheUS. pd f The harm caused by this Courts forays into substantive due process remains immeasurable. Because the Court properly applies our substantive due process precedents to reject the fabrication of a constitutional right to abortion, and be cause this case does not present the opportunity to reject substantive due process entirely, I join the Courts opinion. But, in future cases, we should follow the text of the Constitution, which sets forth certain substantive rights that cannot be taken away, and adds, beyond that, a right to due process when life, liberty, or property is to be taken away. Carl ton , 512 U. S. ,at 42 (opinion of Scalia, J. ).Substantive due process conflict swith that textual command and has harmed our country in many ways. Accordingly, we should eliminate it from our jurisprudence at the earliest opportunity. 1 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) KAVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES No. 191392 THOMAS E. DO BBS, STATE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, E T AL ,.PETITIONERS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION, ETALON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT [June 24, 2022] JUSTICE KAVANAUGH ,concurring. I write separately to explain my additional views about why Roe was wrongly decided, why Roe should be overruled at this time, and the future implications of todays decision. I Abortion is a profoundly difficult and contentious issue because it presents an irreconcilable conflict between the interests of a pregnant woman who seeks an abortion and the interests in protecting fetal life. The interests on both sides of the abortion issue are extraordinarily weighty. On the one side, many pro choice advocates forcefully argue that the ability to obtain an abortion is critically important for womens personal and professional lives, and for womens health. They contend that the widespread availability of abortion has been e essential for women to advance in society and to achieve greater equality over the last 50 years. And they maintain that women must have the freedom to choose for themselves whether to have an abortion. On the other side, many pro life advocates forcefully argue that a fetus is a human life. They contend that all human life should be protected as a matter of human dignity 2 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION KAVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring and fundamental morality. And they stress that a significant percentage of Americans with pro life views are women. When it comes to abortion, one interest must prevail over the other at any given point in a pregnancy. Many Americans of good faith would prioritize the interests of the pregnant woman. Many other Americans of good faith instead would prioritize the interests in protecting fetal lifeatleast unless, for example, an abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother. Of course, many Americans are conflicted or have nuance d views that may vary depending on the particular time in pregnancy, or the particular circumstances of a pregnancy. The issue before this Court, however, is not the policy or morality of abortion. The issue before this Court is what the Constitution says about abortion. The Constitution does not take sides on the issue of abortion. The text of the Constitution does not refer to or encompass abortion. To be sure, this Court has held that the Constitution protects unenumerated rights that are deep ly rooted in this Nations history and tradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. But a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in American history and tradition, as the Court today thoroughly explains. 1 On the question of abortion, the Constitution is therefore neither pro life nor pro choice. The Constitution is neutral and leaves the issue for the people and their elected representatives to resolve through the democratic process in the 1The Courts opinion today also recounts the preconstitutional common law history in England. That English history supplies background information on the issue of abortion. As I see it, the dispositive point in analyzing American history and tradition for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment inquiry is that abortion was largely prohibited in most American States as of 1868 when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, and that abortion remained largely prohibited in most American States until Roe was decided in 1973. 3 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) KAVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring States or Congress like the numerous other difficult questions of American social and economic policy that the Constitution does not address. Because the Constitution is neutral on the issue of abortion, this Court also must be scrupulously neutral. The nine unelected Members of th is Court do not possess the constitutional authority to ov override the democratic process and to decree either a pro life or a pro choice abortion policy for all 330 million people in the United States. Instead of adhering to the Constitutions neutrality, the Court in Roe took sides on the issue and unilaterally decreed that abortion was legal throughout the United State sup to the point of viability (about 24 weeks of pregnancy). The Courts decision today prop properly returns the Court to a position of neutrality and restores the peoples authority to address the issue of abortion through the processes of democratic self government established by the Constitution. Some am icus briefs argue that the Court today should not only overrule Roe and return to a position of judicial neutrality on abortion, but should go further and hold that the Constitution outlaws abortion throughout the United States. No Justice of this Court has ever advanced that position. I respect those who advocate for that position, just as I respect those who argue that this Court should hold that the Constitution legalizes previability abortion throughout the United States. But both positions are wrong as a constitutional matter, in my view. The Constitution neither outlaws abortion nor legalizes abortion. To be clear, then, th e Courts decision today does not outlaw abortion throughout the United States. On the con contrary, the Courts decision properly leaves the question of abortion for the people and their elected representatives in the democratic process. Through that democratic process, the people and their representatives may decide to allow or limit abortion. As Justice Scalia stated, the States may, if they wish, permit abortion on demand, but the Constitution 4 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION KAVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring does not require them to do so. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Ca sey , 505 U. S. 833, 979 (1992) (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Todays decision therefore does not prevent the numerous States that readily allow abortion from continuing to read readily allow abortion. That includes, if they choose, the ami ci States supporting the plaintiff in this Court: New York, California, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Rh ode Island, Vermont, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii. By contrast, other States may maintain laws that more strictly limit abortion. After todays decision, all of the States may evaluate the competing interests and decide how to address this consequential issue. 2 In arguing for a constitutional right to abortion that would override the peoples choices in the democratic process, the plaintiff Jackson Womens Health Organization and its ami ci emphasize that the Constitution does not freeze the American peoples rights as of 1791 or 1868. I fully agree. To begin, I agree that constitutional rights apply to situations that were unforeseen in 1791 or 1868 such as applying the First Amendment to the Internet or the Fourth Amendment to cars. Moreover, the Constitution authorizes the creation of new rights state and federal, statutory and constitutional. But when it comes to creating new rights, the Constitution di directs the people to the various processes of democratic self government contemplated by the Constitution state legislation, state constitutional amendments, federal legislation, and federal constitutional 2In his dissent in Roe, Justice Rehnquist indicated that an exception to a States restriction on abortion would be constitutionally required when an abortion is necessary to sa save the life of the mother. See Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 173 (1973). Abortion statutes traditionally and cur currently provide for an exception when an abortion is necessary to protect the life of the mother. Some statutes also provide other exceptions. 5 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) KAVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring amendments. See generally Amd t. 9; Amd t. 10; Art. I, 8; Art. V; J. Sutton, 51 Imperfect Solutions: States and the Making of American Constitutional Law 7 21, 203216 (2018); A. Amar, Americas Constitution: A Biography 285 291, 315 347 (2005). The Constitution does not grant the nine unelected Members of this Court the unilateral authority to rewrite the Constitution to create new rights and liberties based on our own moral or policy views. As Justice Rehnquist stated, this Court has not been granted a roving commission, either by the Founding Fathers or by the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, to strike down laws that are based upon notions of policy or morality suddenly found unacceptable by a majority of this Court. F urman v. Georgia Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 467 (1972) (dissenting opinion); see Washing ton v. Glucks berg , 521 U. S. 702, 720721 (1997); Cr uzan v. Director, Mo. De pt. of Health Health, 497 U. S. 261, 292293 (1990) (Scalia, J. ,concurring). This Court therefore does not possess the authority either to declare a constitutional right to abortion or to declare a constitutional prohibition of abortion. See Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 953 (Rehnquist, C. J. ,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); id. ,at 980 (opinion of Scalia, J. );Roe v. Wade Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 177 (1973) (Rehnquist, J. ,dissenting); Doe v. Bolt on , 410 U. S. 179, 222 (1973) (White, J. ,dissenting). In sum, the Constitution is neutral on the issue of abortion and allows the people and their elected representatives to address the issue through the democratic process. In my respectful view, the Court in Roe therefore erred by taking sides on the issue of abortion. II The more difficult question in this case is stare dec isis that is, whether to overrule the Roe decision. The principle of stare dec isis requires respect for the 6 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION KAVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring Courts precedents and for the accumulated wisdom of the judges who have previously addressed the same issue. Stare dec isis is rooted in Article III of the Constitution and is fundamental to the American judicial system and to the stability of American law. Adherence to precedent is the norm, and stare dec isis imposes a high bar before this Court may overrule a precedent. This Courts history shows, however, that stare dec isis is not absolute, and indeed cannot be absolute. Otherwise, as the Court today explains, many longsinceoverruled cases such as Plessy v. Ferguson , 163 U. S. 537 (1896); Lochner v. New York York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905); Miners ville School D ist. v. Go bitis , 310 U. S. 586 (1940); and Bowers v. Hard wick , 478 U. S. 186 (1986), would never have been overruled and would still be the law. In his canonical Burnet opinion in 1932, Justice Brandeis stated that in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions. Burnet v. Corona do Oil Gas Co. Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 407 (1932) (dissenting opinion). That description of the Courts practice remains a accurate today. Every current Member of this Court has voted to overrule precedent. And over the last 100 years beginning with Chief Justice Tafts appointment in 1921, every one of the 48 Justices appointed to this Court has voted to ov overrule precedent. Many of those Justices have voted to overrule a substantial number of very significant and long standing precedents. See, e. g. g., Obergefell v. Hod ges , 576 U. S. 644 (2015) (overruling Baker v. Nelson );Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954) (overruling Plessy v. Ferguson );West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish ,300 U. S. 379 (1937) (overruling Ad kins v. Children s Hospital of D. C. and in effect Lochner v. New York). But that history alone does not answer the critical question: When precisely should the Court overrule an erroneous constitutional precedent? The history of stare dec isis in 7 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) KAVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring this Court establishes that a constitutional precedent may be overruled only when (i) th e prior decision is not just wrong, but is egregiously wrong, (ii) the prior decision has caused significant negative jurisprudential or realworldconsequences, and (iii) overruling the prior decision would not unduly upset legitimate reliance interests. See R amos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. S., (2020) (K AVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring in part) (slip o p. ,at 7 8). Applying those factors, I agree with the Court today that Roe should be overruled. The Court in Roe erroneously as signed itself the authority to decide a critically important moral and policy issue that the Constitution does not grant this Court the authority to de decide. As Justice Byron White succinctly explained, Roe was an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review because nothing in the language or history of the Constitution supports a constitutional right to abortion. Bolt on , 410 U. S. ,at 221 222 (dissenting opinion). Of course, the fact that a pr precedent is wrong, even egregiously wrong, does not alone mean that the precedent should be overruled. But as the Court today explains, Roe has caused significant negative jurisprudential and real world consequences. By taking sides on a difficult and contentious issue on which the Constitution is neutral, Roe overreached and exceeded this Courts constitutional authority; gravely distorted the Nations understanding of this Courts proper constitutional role; and caused significant harm to what Roe itself recognized as the States important and legitimate interest in protecting fetal life. 410 U. S. ,at 162. All of that explains why tens of millions of American sand the 26 States t hat explicitly ask the Court to overrule Roe do not accept Roe even 49 years later. Under the Courts longstanding stare dec isis principles, Roe 8 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION KAVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring should be overruled. 3 But the stare dec isis analysis here is somewhat more complicated because of Ca sey In 1992, 19 years after Roe, Ca sey acknowledged the continuing dispute over Roe. The Court sought to find common ground that would resolve the abortion debate and end the national controversy. After careful and thoughtful consideration, the Ca sey plurality reaffirmed a right to abortion through viability (about 24weeks), while also allowing so somewhat more regulation of abortion than Roe had allowed. 4 I have deep and unyielding respect for the Justices who wrote the Ca sey plurality opinion. And I respect the Ca sey pluralitys good faith effort to locate some middle ground or compromise that could resolve this controversy for America. But as has become increasingly evident over time, Ca sey s 3I also agree with the Courts conclusion today with respect to reliance. Broad notions of societal reliance have been invoked in support of Roe, but the Court has not analyzed reliance in that way in the past. For example, American business es and workers relied on Lochner v. New York York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905), and Ad kins v. Children s Hospital of D. C. C., 261 U. S. 525 (1923), to construct a laissezfaire economy that was free of substantial regulation. In West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish ,300 U. S. 379 (1937), the Court nonetheless overruled Ad kins and in effect Lochner An entire region of the country relied on Plessy v. Ferguson , 163 U. S. 537 (1896), to enforce a system of racial segregation. In Brown v. Board of Education Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), the Court overruled Plessy Much of American society was built around th e traditional view of marriage that was upheld in Baker v. Nelson Nelson, 409 U. S. 810 (1972), and that was re reflected in laws ranging from tax laws to estate laws to family laws. In Obergefell v. Hod ges , 576 U. S. 644 (2015), the Court nonetheless overruled Baker 4As the Court today notes, Ca sey s approach to stare dec isis pointed in two directions. Ca sey reaffirmed Roes viability line, but it expressly overruled the Roe trimester framework and al so expressly overruled two landmark post Roe abortion cases Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health ,Inc. Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (1983), and Thorn burgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747 (1986). See Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 870, 872 873, 878 879, 882. Ca sey itself thus directly contradicts any notion of absolute stare dec isis in abortion cases. 9 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) KAVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring well intentioned effort did not resolve the abortion debate. The national division has not ended. In recent years, a significant number of States have enacted abortion restrictions that directly conflict with Roe. Those laws cannot be dismissed as political stunts or as outlier laws. Those numerous state laws collectively represent the sincere and deeply held views of tens of millions of Americans who continue to fervently believe that allowing abortions up to 24weeks is far too radical and far too extreme, and does not sufficiently account for what Roe itself recognized as the States important and legitimate interest in protecting fetal life. 410 U. S. ,at 162. In this case, moreover, a majority of the States26 in al lask the Court to overrule Roe and return the abortion issue to the States. In short, Ca sey s stare dec isis analysis rested in part on a predictive judgment about the future development of state laws and of the peoples views on the abortion issue. But that predictive judgment has not borne out. As the Court today explains, the experience over the last 30 years conflicts with Ca sey s predictive judgment and therefore undermines Ca sey s precedential force. 5 In any event, although Ca sey is relevant to the stare dec isis analysis, the question of whether to overrule Roe cannot be dictated by Ca sey alone. To illustrate that stare de c isis point, consider an example. Suppose that in 1924 this Court had expressly reaffirmed Plessy v. Ferguson and upheld the States authority to segregate people on the basis of race. Would the Court in Brown some 30 years later in 5To be clear, public opposition to a prior decision is not a basis for overruling (or reaffirming) that decision. Rather, the question of whether to overrule a precedent must be analyzed under this Courts traditional stare dec isis factors. The only point here is that Ca sey adopted a special stare dec isis principle with respect to Roe based on the idea of resolving the national controversy and ending th e national division over abortion. The continued and significant opposition to Roe, as reflected in the laws and positions of numerous States, is relevant to assessing Ca sey on its own terms. 10 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION KAVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring 1954 have reaffirmed Plessy and upheld racially segregated schools simply because of that intervening 1924 precedent? Surely the answer is no. In sum, I agree with the Courts application today of the principles of stare dec isis and its conclusion that Roe should be overruled. III After todays decision, the nine Members of this Court will no longer decide the basic legality of previability abortion for all 330 million Americans That issue will be resolved by the people and their representatives in the democratic process in the States or Congress. But the parties arguments have raised other related questions, and I address some of them here. First is the question of how this decision will affect other precedents involving issues such as contraception and marriage in particular, the decisions in Gris wold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird , 405 U. S. 438 (1972); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); and Obergefell v. Hod ges , 576 U. S. 644 (2015). I emphasize what the Court today states: Overruling Roe does not mean the overruling of those precedents, and does not threaten or cast doubt on those precedents. Second, as I see it, some of the other abortion related le gal questions raised by todays decision are not especially difficult as a constitutional matter. For example, may a State bar a resident of that State from traveling to another State to obtain an abortion? In my view, the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel. Maya State retroactively impose liability or punishment for an abortion that occurred before to days decision takes effect? In my view, the answer is no based on the Due Process Clause or the Ex Post Fact o Clause. Cf. Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347 (1964). Other abortion related legal questions may emerge in the 11 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) KAVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring future. But this Court will no longer decide the fundamental question of whether abortion must be allowed throughout the United States through 6 weeks, or 12 weeks, or 15 weeks, or 24 weeks, or some other line. The Court will no longer decide how to evaluate the interests of the pregnant woman and the interests in protecting fetal life throughout pregnancy. Instead, those difficult moral and policy questions will be decided, as the Constitution dictates, by the people and their elected representatives through the constitutional processes of democratic self government. The Roe Court took sides on a consequential moral and policy issue that this Court had no constitutional authority to decide. By taking sides, the Roe Court distorted the Nations understanding of this Courts proper role in the American constitutional system and thereby damaged the Court as an institution. As Justice Scalia explained, Roe destroyed the compromises of th e past, rendered compromise impossible for the future, and required the entire issue to be resolved uniformly, at the national level. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 995 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). The Courts decision today properly returns the Court to a position of judicial neutrality on the issue of abortion, and properly restores the peoples authority to resolve the issue of abortion through the processes of democratic self government established by the Constitution. To be sure, many Americans will disagree with the Courts decision today. That would be true no matter how the Court decided this case. Both sides on the abortion issue believe sincerely and passionately in the rightness of their cause. Especially in those difficult and fraught circumstances, the Court must scrupulously adhere to the Constitutions neutral position on the issue of abortion. Since 1973, more than 20 Justices of this Court have now 12 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION KAVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring grappled with the divisive issue of abortion. I greatly re respect all of the Justices, past and present, who have done so. Amidst extraordinary controversy and challenges, all of them have addressed the abortion issue in good faith after careful deliberation, and based on their sincere understandings of the Constitution and of precedent. I have endeavored to do the same. In my judgment, on the issue of abortion, the Constitution is neither pro life nor pro choice. The Constitution is neutral, and this Court likewise must be scrupulously neutral. The Court today properly heeds the constitutional principle of judicial neutrality and returns the issue of abortion to the people and their elected representatives in the democratic process.

DO BBS, STATE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, E T AL. ,PETITIONERS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION, ETAL.ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT [June 24, 2022] C CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS ,concurring in the judgment. We granted certiorari to decide one question: Whether all p re viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional. Pet. for Cert. i. That question is directly implicated here: Mississippis Gestational Age Act, Miss. Code Ann. 41 41191 (2018), generally prohibits abortion after the fifteenth week of pregnancy several weeks before a fetus is regarded as viable outside the womb. In urging our review, Mississippi stated that its case was an ideal vehicle to reconsider the bright line viability rule, and that a judgment in its favor would not require the Court to overturn Roe v. Wade Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Ca sey , 505 U. S. 833 (1992). Pet. for Cert. 5. Today, the Court nonetheless rules for Mississippi by doing just that. I would take a more measured course. I agree with the Court that the viability line established by Roe and Ca sey should be discarded under a straightforward stare dec isis analysis. That line never made any sense. Our abortion precedents des describe the right at issue as a womans right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. That right should therefore extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, but need not extend any further ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring in judgment 2 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring in judgment certainly not all the way to viability. Mississippis law al lows a woman three months to obtain an abortion, well be yond the point at which it is considered late to discover a pregnancy. See A. Ayoola, Late Recognition of Unintended Pregnancies, 32 Pub. Health Nursing 462 (2015) (pregnancy is discoverable and ordinarily discovered by six weeks of gestation). I see no sound basis for questioning the adequacy of that opportunity. But that is all I would say, out of adherence to a simple yet fundamental principle of judicial restraint: If it is not necessary to decide more to dispose of a case, then it is necessary not to decide more. Perhaps we are not always perfect in following that command, and certainly there arecases that warrant an exception. But this is not one of them. Surely we should adhere closely to principles of judicial restraint here, where the broader path the Court chooses entails repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of stare dec isis The Courts opinion is thoughtful and thorough, but those virtues cannot compensate for the fact that its dramatic and consequential ruling is unnecessary to decide the case before us. I Let me begin with my agreement with the Court, on the only question we need decide here: whether to retain the rule from Roe and Ca sey that a womans right to terminate her pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is regarded as viable outside the womb. I agree that this rule should be discarded. First, this Court seriously erred in Roe in adopting viability as the earliest point at which a State may legislate to advance its substantial interests in the area of abortion. See ante, at 5053. Roe set forth a rigid three part frame work anchored to viability, which more closely resembled a regulatory code than a body of constitutional law. That 3 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring in judgment framework, moreover, came out of thin air. Neither the Texas statute challenged in Roe nor the Georgia statute at issue in its companion case, Doe v. Bolt on , 410 U. S. 179 (1973), included any gestational age limit. No party or am icus asked the Court to adopt a bright line viability rule. And as for Ca sey ,arguments for or against the viability rule played only a de mini mis role in the parties briefing and in the oral argument. See T r. of Oral A rg. 1718, 51 (fleeting discussion of the viability rule). It is thus hardly surprising that neither Roe nor Ca sey made a persuasive or even colorable argument for why the time for terminating a pregnancy must extend to viability. The Courts jurisprudence on this issue is a textbook illustration of the perils of deciding a question neither presented nor briefed. As has been often noted, Roe s defense of the line boiled down to the circular assertion that the States interest is compelling only when an unborn child can live outside the womb, because that is when the unborn child can live outside the womb. See 410 U. S. ,at 163164; see also J. E ly, The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe v. Wade ,82 Yale L. J. 920, 924 (1973) (Roes reasoning mistake[s] a definition for a syllogism). Twenty years later, the best defense of the viability line the Ca sey plurality could conjure up was workability. See 505 U. S. ,at 870. But see ante, at 53 (opinion of the Court) (discussing the difficulties in applying the viability standard). Although the plurality attempted to add more content by opining that it might be said that a woman who fails to act before viability has consented to the States intervention on behalf of the developing child, Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 870, that mere suggestion provides no basis for choosing viability as the critical tipping point. A similar implied consent argument could be made wi th respect to a law banning abortions after fifteen weeks, well beyond the point at which nearly all women are aw are that they are pregnant, A. Ayoola, M. Nett leman, M. Stommel, R. Can ady, Time 4 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring in judgment of Pregnancy Recognition and Prenatal Care Use: A Population based Study in the United States 39 (2010) (Pregnancy Recognition). The dissent, which would retain the viability line, offers no justification for it either. This Courts jurisprudence since Ca sey, moreover, has eroded the under pinnings of the viability line, such as they were. United States v. Gau din, 515 U. S. 506, 521 (1995). The viability line is a relic of a time when we recognized only two state interests warranting regulation of abortion: maternal health and protection of potential life. Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 162163. That changed with Gonzales v. Car hart , 550 U. S. 124 (2007). There, we recognized a broader array of interests, such as drawing a bright line that clearly distinguishes abortion and infanticide, maintaining societal ethics, and preserving the integrity of the medical profession. Id. ,at 157160. The viability line has nothing to do with advancing such permissible goals. Cf. id. ,at 171 (Gins burg, J. ,dissenting) dissenting)( Gonzales blur[red] the line, firmly drawn in Ca sey ,between previability and post viability abortions); see also R. Beck, Gonzales, Ca sey ,and the Viability Rule, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. 249, 276279(2009). Consider, for example, statutes passed in a number of jurisdictions that forbid abortions after twenty weeks of pregnancy, premised on the theory that a fetus can feel pain at that stage of development. See, e. g. ,Ala. Code 2623B2 (2018). Assuming that prevention of fetal pain is a legitimate state interest after Gonzales ,there seems to be no reason why viability would be relevant to the permissibility of such laws. The same is true of laws designed to protect[ ]the integrity and ethics of the medical profession and restrict procedures likely to coarsen society to the dignity of human life. Gonzales, 550 U. S. ,at 157. Mississippis law, for instance, was premised in part on the legislatures finding that the dilation and evacuation procedure is a barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and 5 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring in judgment demeaning to the medical profession. Miss. Code Ann. 4141191(2)(b)(i)(8). That procedure accounts for most abortions performed after the first trimester two weeks before the period at issue in this case and involve[s] the use of surgical instruments to crush and tear the unborn child apart. Ibid. ;see also Gonzales, 550 U. S. ,at 135. Again, it would make little sense to focus on viability when evaluating a law based on these permissible goals. In short, the viability rule was created outside the ordinary course of litigation, is and always has been completely unreasoned, and fails to take account of state interests since recognized as legitimate. It is indeed telling that other countries almost uniformly eschew a viability line. Ante, at 53 (opinion of the Court). Only a handful of countries, among them China and North Korea, permit elective abortions after twenty weeks; the rest have coalesced around a 12week line. See The Worlds Abortion Laws, Center for Reproductive Rights (Feb. 23, 2021) (online source archived at www. supreme court. g ov) (Canada, China, Iceland, Guinea Bissau, the Netherlands, North Korea, Singapore, and Vietnam permit elective abortions after twenty weeks). The Court rightly rejects the arbitrary viability rule today. II None of this, however, requires that we also take the dramatic step of altogether eliminating the abortion right first recognized in Roe. Mississippi itself previously argued as much to this Court in this litigation. When the State petitioned for our review, its basic request was straightforward: clarify whether abortion prohibitions before viability are always unconstitutional. Pet. for Cert. 14. The State made a number of strong arguments that the answer is no, id. ,at 1526arguments that, as discussed, I find persuasive. And it went out of its way to make clear that it was not asking the Court to repudiate 6 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring in judgment entirely the right to choose whether to terminate a pregnancy: To be clear, the questions presented in this petition do not require the Court to overturn Roe or Ca sey .Id. ,at 5. Mississippi tempered that statement with an oblique one sentence footnote intimating that, if the Court could not reconcile Roe and Ca sey with current facts or other cases, it should not retain e erroneous precedent. Pet. for Cert. 56, n. 1. But the State never argued that we should grant review for that purpose. After we granted certiorari, however, Mississippi changed course. In its principal brief, the State bluntly an announced that the Court should overrule Roe and Ca sey The Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion, it argued, and a State should be able to prohibit elective abortions if a rational basis supports doing so. See Brief for Petitioners 1213. The Court now rewards that gambit, noting three times that the parties presented no half measures and argued that we must either reaffirm or overrule Roe and Ca sey .Ante, at 5, 8, 72. Given those two options, the majority picks the latter. This framing is not accurate. In its brief on the merits, Mississippi in fact argued at length that a decision simply rejecting the viability rule would result in a judgment in its favor. See Brief for Petitioners 5, 3848. But even if the State had not argued as much, it would not matter. There is no rule that parties can confine this Court to disposing of their case on a particular g roundlet alone when review was sought and granted on a different one. Our established practice is instead not to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied. Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party Party, 552 U. S. 442, 450 (2008) (quoting Ash wander v. T VA , 297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J. ,concurring)); see also United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 21 (1960). 7 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring in judgment Following that fundamental principle of judicial restraint, Washington State Grange, 552 U. S. ,at 450, we should begin with the narrowest basis for disposition, proceeding to consider a broader one only if necessary to resolve the case at hand. See, e. g. ,Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U. S. 414, 423 (1990). It is only where there is no valid narrower ground of decision that we should go on to address a broader issue, such as whether a constitutional decision should be overturned. See Federal Election Commn v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 482 (2007) (declining to address the claim that a constitutional decision should be overruled when the appellant prevailed on its narrower constitutional argument). Here, there is a clear path to deciding this case correctly without overruling Roe all the way down to the studs: recognize that the viability line mu st be discarded, as the majority rightly does, and leave for another day whether to re reject any right to an abortion at all. See Webster v. Reproductive Health Services Services, 492 U. S. 490, 518, 521 (1989) (plurality opinion) (rejecting Roes viability line as rigid and indeterminate, while also finding no occasion to revisit the holding of Roe that, under the Constitution, a State must provide an opportunity to choose to terminate a pregnancy). Of course, such an approach would not be available if the rationale of Roe and Ca sey was inextricably entangled with and dependent upon the viability standard. It is not. Our precedents in this area ground the abortion right in a womans right to choose. See Car ey v. Population Services In tl, 431 U. S. 678, 688689 (1977) (underlying foundation of the holdings in Roe and Gris wold v. Connecticut Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965), was the right of decision in matters of childbearing); Ma her v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464, 473 (1977) (Roe and other cases recognize a co constitutionally protected interest in making certain kinds of important decisions free from governmental compulsion (internal quotation marks 8 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring in judgment omitted)); id. ,at 473474 (Roe did not declare an unqualified constitutional right to an abortion, but instead protected the woman from unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy (internal quotation marks omitted)); Webster Webster, 492 U. S. ,at 520 (plurality opinion) (Roe protects the claims of a woman to decide for herself whether or not to abort a fetus she [is] carrying); Gonzales, 550 U. S. ,at 146 (a State may not prohibit any woman from ma king the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy). If that is the basis for Roe, Roes viability line should be scrutinized from the same per perspective. And there is nothing inherent in the right to choose that requires it to extend to viability or any other point, so long as a real choice is provided. See Webster Webster, 492 U. S. ,at 519 (plurality opinion) (finding no reason why the States interest in protecting potential human life should come into existence only at the point of viability). To be sure, in reaffirming the right to an abortion, Ca sey termed the viability rule Roes central holding. 505 U. S. ,at 860. Other cases of ours have repeated that language. See, e. g. g., Gonzales, 550 U. S. ,at 145146. But simply declaring it does not make it so. The question in Roe was whether there was any right to abortion in the Constitution. See Brief for Appellants and Brief for Appellee s, in Roe v. Wade, O. T. 1971, No. 7018. How far the right ex tended was a concern that was separate and subsidiary, and not surprisingly entirely unbriefed. The Court in Roe just chose to address both issues in one opinion: It first recognized a right to choose to terminate [a] pregnancy under the Constitution, see 410 U. S. ,at 129159, and then, having done so, explained that a line should be drawn at viability such that a State could not proscribe abortion before that period, see id. ,at 163. The viability line is a separate rule fleshing out the metes and bounds of Roes core holding. Applying principles of stare dec isis, I would excise that additional rule and only that 9 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring in judgment rule from our jurisprudence. The majority lists a number of cases that have stressed the importance of the viability rule to our abortion precedents. See ante, at 7374. I agree that whether it was originally holding or dictum the viability line is clearly part of our past precedent, and the Court has applied it as such in several cases since Roe. Ante, at 73. My point is that Roe adopted two distinct rules of constitutional law: one, that a woman has the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy; two, that such right may be overridden by the States legitimate interests when the fetus is viable outside the womb. The latter is obviously distinct from the former. I would abandon that timing rule, but see no need in this case to consider the basic right. The Court contends that it is impossible to address Roes conclusion that the Constitution protects the womans right to abortion, without also addressing Roes rule that the States interests are not constitutionally adequate to justify a ban on abortion until viability. See ibid. But we have partially overruled precedents before, see, e. g. ,United States v. Miller Miller, 471 U. S. 130, 142144 (1985); Daniels v. Williams Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 328331 (1986); Bat son v. Kentucky Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, 9093 (1986), and certainly have never held that a distinct holding defining the contours of a constitutional right must be treated as part and parcel of the right itself. Overruling the subsidiary rule is sufficient to resolve this case in Mississippis favor. The law at issue allows abortions up through fifteen weeks, providing an adequate opportunity to exercise the right Roe protects. By the time a pregnant woman has reached that point, her pregnancy i swell into the second trimester. Pregnancy tests are now in expensive and accurate, and a woman ordinarily discovers she is pregnant by six weeks of gestation. See A. Bran um K. Ahrens, Trends in Timing of Pregnancy Awareness Among US Women, 21 Maternal Child Health J. 715, 722 10 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring in judgment (2017). Almost all know by the end of the first trimester. Pregnancy Recognition 39. Safe and effective abortifacients, moreover, are now readily available, particularly during those early stages. See I. Adibi e t al. ,Abortion, 22 Geo. J. Gender L. 279, 303 (2021). Given all this, it is no surprise that the vast majority of abortions happen in the first trimester. See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Abortion Surveillance United States 1 (2020). Presumably most of the remainder would also take place earlier if later abortions were not a legal option. Ample evidence thus suggests that a 15-week ban provides sufficient time, absent rare circumstances ,for a woman to decide for herself whether to terminate her pregnancy. Webster, 492 U. S. ,at 520 (plurality opinion). III Whether a precedent should be overruled is a question entirely within the discretion of the court. Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205, 212 (1910); see also Pay ne v. Tennessee Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991) (stare dec isis is a principle of pol icy). In my respectful view, the sound exercise of that dis cretion should have led the Court to resolve the case on the narrower grounds set forth above, rather than overruling Roe and Ca sey entirely. The Court says there is no principled basis for this approach, ante, at 73, but in fact it is firmly grounded in basic principles of stare dec isis and judicial restraint. The majority contends that not hing like [my approach] was recommended by either party. Ante, at 72. But as explained, Mississippi in fact pressed a similar argument in its filings before this Court. See Pet. for Cert. 1526; Brief for Petitioners 5, 3848 (urging the Court to reject the viability rule and reverse); Reply Brief 2022 (same). The approach also finds support in prior opinions. See Webster Webster, 492 U. S. ,at 518521 (plurality opinion) (abandoning key elements of the Roe framework under stare dec isis while declining to reconsider Roes holding that the Constitution protects the right to an abortion). 11 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring in judgment The Courts decision to overrule Roe and Ca sey is a serious jolt to the legal system regardless of how you view those cases. A narrower decision rejecting the misguided viability line would be markedly less unsettling, and nothing more is needed to decide this case. Our cases say that the effect of overruling a precedent on reliance interests is a factor to consider in deciding whether to take such a step, and respondents argue that generations of women have relied on the right to an abortion in organizing their relationships and planning their futures. Brief for Respondents 3641; see also Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 856 (making the same point). The Court questions whether these concerns are pertinent under our precedents, see ante, at 6465, but the issue would not even arise with a decision rejecting only the viability line: It cannot reasonably be argued that women have shaped their lives in part on the assumption that they would be able to abort up to viability, as opposed to fifteen weeks. In support of its holding, the Court cites three seminal constitutional decisions that involved overruling prior precedents: Brown v. Board of Education Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette , 319 U. S. 624 (1943), and West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish ,300 U. S. 379 (1937). See ante, at 4041. The opinion in Brown was unanimous and eleven pages long; this one is neither. Barnette was decided only three years after the decision it overruled, three Justices having had second thoughts. And West Coast Hotel was issued against a backdrop of unprecedented economic despair that focused attention on the fundamental flaws of existing precedent. It also was part of a sea change in this Courts interpretation of the Constitution, signal[ing] the demise of an entire line of important precedents, ante, at 40a feature the Court expressly disclaims in todays decision, see ante, at 32, 66. None of these leading cases, in short, provides a template for what the Court does today. 12 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring in judgment The Court says we should co consider whether to overrule Roe and Ca sey now, because if we delay we would be forced to consider the issue again in short order. See ante, at 76 77. There would be turmoil until we did so, according to the Court, because of existing state laws with shorter deadlines or no deadline at all. Ante ,at 76. But under the narrower approach proposed here, state laws outlawing abortion altogether would still violate binding precedent. And to the extent States have laws that set the cutoff date earlier than fifteen weeks, any litigation over that time frame would proceed free of the distorting effect that the viability rule has had on our constitutional debate. The same could be true, for that matter, with respect to legislative consideration in the States. We would then be free to exercise our discretion in de deciding whether and when to take up the issue, from a more informed perspective. Both the Courts opinion and the dissent display a relentless freedom from doubt on the legal issue that I cannot share. I am not sure, for example, that a ban on terminating a pregnancy from the moment of conception must be treated the same under the Constitution as a ban after fifteen weeks. A thoughtful Member of this Court once counseled that the difficulty of a question admonishes us to ob serve the wise limitations on our function and to confine ourselves to deciding only what is necessary to the disposition of the immediate case. White house v. Illinois Central R. Co. Co., 349 U. S. 366, 372373 (1955) (Frankfurter, J. ,for the Court). I would decide th e question we granted review to answer whether the previously recognized abortion right bars all abortion restrictions prior to viability, such that a ban on abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy is necessarily unlawful. The answer to that question is no, and there is no need to go further to decide this case. I therefore concur only in the judgment. KA GAN ,J. ,dissenting 1 Cite as: 597 U. S.

JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION, ETALON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT [June 24, 2022] JUSTICE BR EYER ,JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR ,and JUSTICE KA GAN ,dissenting. For half a century, Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Ca sey , 505 U. S. 833 (1992), have protected the liberty and equality of women. Roe held, and Ca sey reaffirmed, that the Constitution safeguards a womans right to decide for herself whether to bear a child. Roe held, and Ca sey reaffirmed, that in the first stages of pregnancy, the government could not make that choice for women. The government could not control a womans body or the course of a womans life: It could not determine what the womans future would be. See Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 853; Gonzales v. Car hart , 550 U. S. 124, 171172 (2007) (Gins burg, J. ,dissenting). Respecting a woman as an autonomous being, and granting her full equality, meant giving her substantial choice over this most personal and most consequential of all life decisions. Roe and Ca sey well understood the difficulty and divisiveness of the abortion issue. The Court knew that Americans hold profoundly different view s about the moral[ity] of terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage. Ca sey, 505 U. S. ,at 850. And the Court recognized that the 2 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child. Id. ,at 846. So the Court struck a balance, as it often does when values and goals compete. It held that the State could prohibit abortions after fetal viability, so long as the ban contained exceptions to safeguard a womans life or health. It held that even before viability, the State could regulate the abortion procedure in multiple and meaningful ways. But until the viability line was crossed, the Court held, a State could not impose a substantial obstacle on a womans right to elect the procedure as she (not the government) thought proper, in light of all the circumstances and complexities of her own life. Ibid. Today, the Court discards that balance. It says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs. An abor abortion restriction, the majority holds, is permissible whenever rational, the lowest level of scrutiny known to the law. And because, as the Court has often stated, protecting fetal life is rational, States will feel free to enact all manner of restrictions. The Mississippi la w at issue here bars abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy. Under the majoritys ruling, though, another States law could do so after ten weeks, or five or three or one or, again, from the moment of fertilization. States have already passed such laws, in anticipation of todays ruling. More will follow. Some States have enacted laws extending to all forms of abortion procedure, including taking medication in ones own home. They have passed laws without any except ions for when the woman is the victim of rape or incest. Under those laws, a woman will have to bear her rapists child or a young girl her fathers no matter if doing so will destroy her life. So too, after todays ruling, some States may compel women to carry to term a fetus with severe physical anomalies for example, one afflicted with Ta ySachs disease, sure to die 3 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting within a few years of birth. States may even argue that a prohibition on abortion need make no provision for protecting a woman from risk of death or physical harm. Across a vast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose its moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child. Enforcement of all these draconian restrictions will also be left largely to the States devices. A State can of course impose criminal penalties on abortion providers, including lengthy prison sentences. But some States will not stop there. Perhaps, in the wake of todays decision, a state law will criminalize the womans conduct too, incarcerating or fining her for daring to seek or obtain an abortion. And as Texas has recently shown, a State can turn neighbor against neighbor, enlisting fellow citizens in the effort to root out anyone who tries to get an abortion, or to assist another in doing so. The majority tries to hide the geographically expansive effects of its holding. Todays decision, the majority says, permits each State to address abortion as it pleases. Ante ,at 79. That is cold comfort, of course, for the poor woman who cannot get the money to fly to a distant State for a procedure. Above all other s, women lacking financial resources will suffer from todays decision. In any event, interstate restrictions will also so on be in the offing. After this decision, some States may block women from traveling out of State to obtain abortions, or even from receiving abortion medications from out of State. Some may criminalize efforts, including the provision of information or funding, to help women gain access to other States abortion services. Most threatening of all, no language in todays decision stops the Federal Government from prohibiting abortions nationwide, once again from th e moment of conception and without exceptions for rape or incest. If that happens, the views of [an individual States] citizens will not matter. Ante ,at 1. The challenge for a woman will be to finance a 4 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting trip not to New York [or] Ca California but to Toronto. Ante ,at 4 (K AVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring). Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of todays decision is certain: the curtailment of womens rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens. Yesterday, the Constitution guaranteed that a woman confronted with an unplanned pregnancy could (within reasonable limits) make her own decision about whether to bear a child, with all the life transforming consequences that act involves. And in thus safeguarding each womans reproductive freedom, the Constitution also protected [t]he ability of women to participate equally in [this Nations] economic and social life. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 856. But no longer. As of today, this Court holds, a State can always force a woman to give birth, prohibiting even the earliest abortions. A State can thus transform what, when freely undertaken, is a wonder into what, when forced, may be a nightmare. Some women, especially women of means, will find ways around the States assertion of power. Othersthose without money or childcare or the ability to take time off from work will not be so fortunate. Maybe they will try an unsafe method of abortion, and come to physical harm, or even die. Maybe they will undergo pregnancy and have a child ,but at significant personal or familial cost. At the least, they will incur the cost of losing control of their lives. The Constitution will, todays majority holds, provide no shield, despite its guarantees of liberty and equality for all. And no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work. The right Roe and Ca sey recognized does not stand alone. To the contrary, the Court has linked it for decades to other settled freedoms involving bodily integrity, familial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the right to terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the right to purchase and use contraception. See Gris Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird , 405 U. S. 438 (1972). In turn, those rights led, more recently, 5 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting to rights of same sex intimacy and marriage. See Lawrence Texas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003); Obergefell v. Hod ges , 576 U. S. 644 (2015). They are all part of the same constitutional fabric, protecting autonomous decision making over the most personal of life decisions. The majority (or to be more accurate, most of it) is eager to tell us today that nothing it does cast[s] doubt on pr precedents that do not concern abortion. Ante ,at 66; cf. ante, at 3 (T (THOMAS ,J. ,concurring) (advocating the overruling of Gris wold, Lawrence, and Obergefell). But how could that be? The lone rationale for what the majority does today is that the right to elect an abortion is not deeply rooted in history: Not until Roe, the majority argues, did people think abortion fell within the Constitutions guarantee of liberty. Ante ,at 32. The same could be said, though, of most of the rights the majority claims it is not tampering with. The majority could write just as long an opinion showing, for example, that until the mid-20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain [contraceptives]. Ante ,at 15. So one of two things must be true. Either the majority does not really believe in its own reasoning. Or if it does, all rights that have no history stretching back to the mid-19th century are insecure. Either the mass of the majoritys opinion is hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are under threat. It is one or the other. One piece of evidence on that score seems especially salient: The majoritys cavalier approach to overturning this Courts precedents. Stare dec isis is the Latin phrase for a foundation stone of the rule of law: that things decided should stay decided unless there is a very good reason for change. It is a doctrine of judicial modesty and humility. Those qualities are not evident in todays opinion. The majority has no good reason for the upheaval in law and society it sets off. Roe and Ca sey have been the law of the land for decades, shaping womens expectations of their choices when an unplanned pregnancy occurs. Women have relied 6 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting on the availability of abortion both in structuring their relationships and in planning their lives. The legal frame work Roe and Ca sey developed to balance the competing in interests in this sphere has proved workable in courts across the country. No recent developments, in either law or fact, have eroded or cast doubt on th ose precedents. Nothing, in short, has changed. Indeed, the Court in Ca sey already found all of that to be true. Ca sey is a precedent about precedent. It reviewed the same arguments made here in support of overruling Roe, and it found that doing so was not warranted. The Court reverses course today for one reason and one reason only: because the composition of this Court has changed. Stare dec isis ,this Court has often said, contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process by ensuring that decisions are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals. Pay Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991); Vasquez v. Hiller y , 474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986). Today, the proclivities of individuals rule. The Court departs from its obligation to faithfully and impartially apply the law. We dissent. I We start with Roe and Ca sey ,and with their deep connections to a broad swath of this Courts precedents. To hear the majority tell the tale, Roe and Ca sey are aberrations: They came from nowhere, went nowhere and so are easy to excise from constitutional law. That is not true. After describing the decisions themselves, we explain how they are rooted in and themselves led toother rights giving individuals control over their bodies and their most personal and intimate associations. The majority does not wish to talk about these ma matters for obvious reasons; to do so would both ground Roe and Ca sey in this Courts precedents and reveal the broad implications of todays decision. But the facts will not so handily disappear. Roe and Ca sey were from the beginning, and are even more now, embedded 7 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting in core constitutional concepts of individual freedom, and of the equal rights of citizens to decide on the shape of their lives. Those legal concepts, one might even say, have gone far toward defining what it means to be an American. For in this Nation, believe that a government controlling all private choices is compatible with a free people. So we do not (as the majority insists today) place everything within the reach of majorities and [government] officials. West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 638 (1943). We believe in a Constitution that puts some issues off limits to majority rule. Even in the face of public opposition, we uphold the right of individuals yes, including women to make their own choices and chart their own futures. Or at least, we did once. A Some half century ago, Roe struck down a state law making it a crime to perform an abortion unless its purpose was to save a womans life. The Roe Court knew it was treading on difficult and disputed ground. It understood that different peoples experiences, values, and religious training and beliefs led to opposing views about abortion. 410 U. S. ,at 116. But by a 7-to-2 vote, the Court held that in the earlier stages of pregnancy, that contested and contestable choice must belong to a woman, in consultation with her family and doctor. The Court explained that a long line of precedents, founded in the Fourteenth Amendments concept of personal liberty, protected individual decision making related to marri age, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education. Id. ,at 152153 (citations omitted). For the same reasons, the Court held, the Constitution must protect a womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. Id. ,at 153. The Court recognized the myriad ways bearing a child can alter the life and future of a woman and other 8 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting members of her family. Ibid. A State could not, by adopting one theory of life, override all rights of the pregnant woman. Id. ,at 162. At the same time, though, the Court recognized valid interest[s] of the State in regulating the abortion decision. Id. ,at 153. The Court noted in particular important interests in protecting potential life, maintaining medical standards, and safeguarding [the] health of the woman. Id. ,at 154. No absolut[ist] account of the womans right could wipe away those significant state claims. Ibid. The Court therefore struck a balance, turning on the stage of the pregnancy at which the abortion would occur. The Court explained that early on, a womans choice must prevail, but that at some point the state interests become dominant. Id. ,at 155. It then set some guideposts. In the first trimester of pregnancy, the State could not interfere at all with the decision to terminate a pregnancy. At any time after that point, the State could regulate to protect the pregnant womans health, such as by insisting that abortion providers and facilities meet safety requirements. And after the fetuss viability the point when the fetus has the capability of meaningful life outside the mothers womb the State could ban abortions, except when necessary to preserve the womans life or health. Id. ,at 163164. In the 20 years between Roe and Ca sey ,the Court expressly reaffirmed Roe on two occasions, and applied it on many more. Recognizing that arguments [against Roe] continue to be made, we responded that the doctrine of stare dec isis demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law. Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 419420 (1983). And we avowed that the vitality of constitutional principles cannot be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them. Thorn burgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 759 (1986). So the Court, over and 9 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting over, enforced the constitutional principles Roe had declared. See, e. g. ,Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health Health, 497 U. S. 502 (1990); Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417 (1990); Simopoulos v. Virginia Virginia, 462 U. S. 506 (1983); Planned Parenthood As sn. of Kansas City, Mo. ,Inc. v. Ash croft , 462 U. S. 476 (1983); H. L. v. Mathes on , 450 U. S. 398 (1981); Bellotti v. Baird , 443 U. S. 622 (1979); Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Dan forth, 428 U. S. 52 (1976). Then, in Ca sey ,the Court considered the matter anew, and again upheld Roes core precepts. Ca sey is in significant measure a precedent about the doctrine of precedent until today, one of the Courts most important. But we leave for later that aspect of the Courts decision. The key thing now is the substantive aspect of the Courts considered conclusion that the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed. 505 U. S. ,at 846. Central to that conclusion was a full throated restatement of a womans right to choose. Like Roe, Ca sey grounded that right in the Fourteenth guarantee of liberty. That guarantee encompasses realms of conduct not specifically referenced in the Constitution: Marriage is mentioned nowhere in that document, yet the Court was no doubt correct to protect the freedom to marry against state interference. 505 U. S. ,at 847848. And the guarantee of liberty encompasses conduct today that was not protected at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment. See id. ,at 848. It is settled now, the Court said though it was not always so that the Constitution places limits on a States right to interfere with a persons most basic decisions about family and parenthood, as well as bodily integrity. Id. ,at 849 (citations omitted); see id. ,at 851 (similarly describing the constitutional protection given to personal decisions re relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, [and] family relationships). Especially 10 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting important in this web of precedents protecting an individuals most personal choices were those guaranteeing the right to contraception. Ibid. ;see id. ,at 852853. In those cases, the Court had recognized the right of the individual to make the vastly consequent consequential decision whether to bear a child. Id. ,at 851 (emphasis deleted). So too, Ca sey reasoned, the liberty clause protects the decision of a woman confronting an unplanned pregnancy. Her decision about abortion was central, in the same way, to her capacity to chart her lifes course. See id. ,at 853. In reaffirming the right Roe recognized, the Court took full account of the diversity of views on abortion, and the importance of various competing state interests. Some Americans, the Court stated, deem [abortion] nothing short of an act of violence against innocent human life. 505 U. S. ,at 852. And each State has an interest in the protection of potential life as Roe itself had recognized. 505 U. S. ,at 871 (plurality opinion). On the one hand, that interest was not conclusive. Th e State could not resolve the moral and spiritual questions raised by abortion in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter. Id. ,at 850 (majority opinion). It could not force her to bear the pain and physical constraints of carr[ying] a child to full term when she would have chosen an early abortion. Id. ,at 852. But on the other hand, the State had, as Roe had held, an exceptionally significant interest in disallowing abortions in the later phase of a pregnancy. And it had an ever present interest in ensur[ing] that the womans choice is informed and in presenting the case for choos[ing] childbirth over abortion. 505 U. S. ,at 878 (plurality opinion). So Ca sey again struck a balance, differing from Roes in only incremental ways. It retained Roes central holding that the State could bar abortion only after viability. 505 U. S. ,at 860 (majority opinion). The viability line, Ca sey thought, was more workable than any other in marking 11 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting the place where the womans liberty interest gave way to a States efforts to preserve potential life. Id. ,at 870 (plurality opinion). At that point, a second life was capable of independent existence. Ibid. If the woman even by then had not acted, she lacked adequate grounds to object to th eStates intervention on [the developing childs] behalf. Ibid. At the same time, Ca sey decided, based on two decades of experience, that the Roe framework did not give States sufficient ability to regulate abortion prior to viability. In that period, Ca sey now made clear, the State could regulate not only to protect th e womans health but also to promot[e] prenatal life. 505 U. S. ,at 873 (plurality opinion). In particular, the State could ensure informed choice and could try to promote childbirth. See id. ,at 877878. But the State still could not place an undue burden or substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion. Id. ,at 878. Prior to viability, the woman, consistent with the constitutional meaning of liberty, must retain the ultimate control over her destiny and her body. Id. ,at 869. We make one initial point about this analysis in light of the majoritys insistence that Roe and Ca sey ,and we in defending them, are dismissive of a States interest in protecting prenatal life. Ante ,at 38. Nothing could get those decisions more wrong. As just described, Roe and Ca sey invoked powerful state interests in that protection, operative at every stage of the pregnancy and overriding the womans liberty after viability. The strength of those state interests is exactly why the Court allowed greater restrictions on the abortion right than on other rights deriving from the Four Fourteenth Amendment. 1 But what Roe and Ca sey also recognized which todays majority does n otis that a womans 1For this reason, we do not understand the majoritys view that our analogy between the right to an abort ion and the rights to contraception and same sex marriage shows that we think [t]he Constitution does not permit the States to regard the destruction of a potential life as a matter 12 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting freedom and equality are likewise involved. That fact the presence of countervailing interest sis what made the abortion question hard, and what necessitated balancing. The majority scoffs at that id ea, castigating us for repeatedly prais[ing] the balance the two cases arrived at (with the word balance in scare quotes). Ante ,at 38. To the majority balance is a dirty word, as moderation is a for foreign concept. The majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a womans rights to equality and freedom. Todays Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a womans control of her body and the path of her life. Roe and Ca sey thought that one sided view misguided. In some sense, that is the difference in a nutshell between our precedents and the majority opinion. The constitutional regime we have lived in for the last 50 years recognized competing interests, and sought a balance between them. The constitutional regime we enter toda y erases the womans interest and recognizes only the States (or the Federal Governments). B The majority makes this change based on a single question: Did the reproductive right recognized in Roe and Ca sey of any significance. Ante, at 38. To the contrary. The liberty interests underlying those rights are, as we will describe, quite similar. See infra ,at 2224. But only in the sphere of abortion is the state interest in protecting potential life involved. So only in that sphere, as both Roe and Ca sey recognized, may a State impinge so far on the liberty interest (barring abortion after viability and discouraging it before). The majoritys failure to understand this fairly obvious point stems from its rejection of the idea of balancing interests in th is (or maybe in any) constitutional context. Cf. New York State Rifle Pistol As sn. ,Inc. v. B ruen , S.,, (2022) (slip o p. ,at 8, 1517). The majority thinks that a woman has no liberty or equality interest in the decision to bear a child, so a States interest in protecting fetal life necessarily prevails. 13 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting exist in 1868, the year when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified? Ante ,at 23. The majority says (and with this much we agree) that the answer to this question is no: In 1868, there was no nationwide right to end a pregnancy, and no thought that the Fourteenth Amendment provided one. Of course, the majority opinion refers as well to some later and earlier history. On the one side of 1868, it goes back as far as the 13th (the 13th) century. See ante, at 17. But that turns out to be wheel spinning. First, it is not clear what relevance such early history should have, even to the majority. See New York State Rifle Pistol As sn. ,Inc. v. B ruen , 597 U. S., (2022) (slip o p. ,at 26) (His (Historical evidence that long predates [ratification] may not illuminate the scope of the right). If the early history obviously supported abortion rights, the majority would no doubt say that only the views of the Fourteenth Amendments ratifiers are germane. See ibid. (It is better not to go too far back into antiquity, except if olden law survived to become our Founders law). Second and embarrassingly for the majority early la w in fact does provide some support for abortion rights. Common law authorities did not treat abortion as a crime before quickening the point when the fetus moved in the womb. 2 And early American law followed the common law rule. 3 So the criminal law of that early time might be take n as roughly consonant with 2See, e. g. ,1 W. Black stone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 129130 (7th ed. 1775) (Black stone); E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England 50 (1644). 3See J. Mohr, Abortion in America: The Origin National Policy, 18001900, p p. 34 (1978). The majority offers no evidence to the contrary no example of a founding era law making p re quickening abortion a crime (except when a woman died). See ante ,at 2021. And even in the mid-19th century, more than 10 States continued to allow prequickening abortions. See Brief for American Historical Association e t al. as Ami ci Curiae 27, and n. 14. 14 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting Roes and Ca sey abortions. Better, then, to move forward in time. On the other side of 1868, the majority occasionally notes that many States barred abortion up to the time of Roe See ante ,at 24, 36. That is convenient for the majority, but it is window dressing. As the same majority (plus one) just informed us, po stratification adoption or acceptance of laws that are inconsistent with the original meaning of the constitutional text obviously cannot overcome or alter that text. New York State Rifle Pistol As sn. Inc., 597 U. S. ,at (slip o p. ,at 2728). Had the p re Roe liberalization of abortion laws occurred more quickly and more widely in the 20th century, the majority would say (once again) that only the ratifiers views are germane. The majoritys core legal postulate, then, is that we in the 21st century must read the Fourteenth Amendment just a sits ratifiers did. And that is indeed what the majority emphasizes over and over again. See ante, at 47 ([T]he most important historical fact [is] how the States regulated abortion when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted); see also ante, at 5, 16, and n. 24, 23, 25, 28. If the ratifiers did not understand something as central to freedom, then neither can we. Or said more particularly: If those people did not understand reproductive rights as part of the guarantee of liberty conferred in the Fourteenth Amendment, then those rights do not exist. As an initial matter, note a mistake in the just preceding sentence. We referred there to the people who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment: What rights did those people have in their heads at the time? But, of course, people did not ratify the Fourteenth Amendment. Men did. So it is perhaps not so surprising that the ratifiers were not perfectly attuned to the importance of reproductive rights for womens liberty, or for their capacity to participate as equal members of our Nation. Indeed, the ratifiers both in 1868 and when the original Constitution was approved in 1788 15 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting did not understand women as full members of the community embraced by the phrase We the People. In 1868, the first wave of American feminists were explicitly told of course by men that it was not their time to seek constitutional protections. (Women would not get even the vote for another half century. )To be sure, most women in 1868 also had a foreshortened view of their rights: If most men could not then imagine giving women control over their bodies, most women could not imagine having that kind of autonomy. But that takes away nothing from the core point. Those responsible for the original Constitution, including the Fourteenth Amendment, did not perceive women as equals, and did not recognize womens rights. When the majority says that we must read our foundational charter as viewed at the time of ratification (except that we may also check it against the Dark Ages), it consigns women to second class citizenship. Ca sey itself understood this point, as will become clear. See infra ,at 2324. It recollected with dismay a decision this Court issued just five years after the Fourteenth Amendments ratification, approving a States decision to deny a law license to a woman and suggesting as well that a woman had no legal status apart from her husband. See 505 U. S. ,at 896897 (majority opinion) (citing Bra dwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873)). There was a time, Ca sey explained, when the Constitution did not protect men and women alike. 505 U. S. ,at 896. But times had changed. A womans place in society had changed, and constitutional law had changed along with it. The relegation of women to inferior public sphere or the family was no longer consistent with our understanding of the Constitution. Id. ,at 897. Now, [t]he Constitution protects all individuals, male or female, from the abuse of governmental power or unjustified state interference. Id. ,at 896, 898. So how is it that, as Ca sey said, our Constitution, read 16 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting now, grants rights to women, though it did not in 1868? How is it that our Constitution subjects discrimination against them to heightened judicial scrutiny? How is it that our Constitution, through the Fourteenth Amendments liberty clause, guarantees access to contraception (also not legally protected in 1868) so that women can decide for them selves whether and when to bear a child? How is it that until today, that same constitutional clause protected a womans right, in the event contraception failed, to end a pregnancy in its earlier stages? The answer is that this Court has rejected the majoritys pinched view of how to read our Constitution. The Founders, we recently wrote, knew they were writing a document designed to apply to ever changing circumstances over centuries. NLRB v. Noel Canning Canning, 573 U. S. 513, 533534 (2014). Or in the words of the great Chief Justice John Marshall, our Constitution is intended to endure for ages to come, and must adapt itself to a future seen dimly, if at all. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819). That is indeed why our Constitution is written as it is. The Framers (both in 1788 and 1868) understood that the world changes. So they did not define rights by reference to the specific practices ex existing at the time. Instead, the Framers defined rights in general terms, to permit future evolution in their scope and meaning. And over the course of our history, this Court has taken up the Framers invitation. It has kept true to the Framers principles by applying them in new ways, re responsive to new societal understandings and conditions. Nowhere has that approach been more prevalent than in construing the majestic but open ended words of the Fourteenth Amendment the guarantees of liberty and equality for all. And nowhere has that approach produced prouder moments, for this country and the Court. Consider an example Obergefell used a few years ago. The Court 17 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting there confronted a claim, based on Washington v. Glucks berg, 521 U. S. 702 (1997), that the Fourteenth Amendment must be defined in a most circumscribed manner, with central reference to specific historical practices exactly the view todays majority follows. Obergefell, 576 U. S. ,at 671. And the Court specifically rejected that view. 4 In doing so, the Court reflected on what the proposed, historically circumscribed approach would have meant for interracial marriage. See ibid. The Fourteenth Amendments ratifiers did not think it gave black and white people a right to marry each other. To the contrary, contemporaneous practice deemed that act quite as unprotected as abortion. Yet the Court Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967), read the Fourteenth Amendment to embrace the Lovings union. If, Obergefell explained, rights were defined by who exercised them in the past, then received practices could serve as their own continued justification even when they conflict with liberty and equality as later and more broadly understood. 576 U. S. ,at 671. The Constitution does not freeze for all time the original view of what those rights guarantee, or how they apply. That does not mean anything goes. The majority wishes people to think there are but two alternatives: (1) accept the original applications of the Fourteenth Amendment and no other s, or (2) surrender to judges own ardent views, un grounded in law, about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. Ante ,at 14. At least, that idea is what the majority sometimes tries to convey. At other times, the majority (or, rather, most of it) tries to assure the public that it has no designs on rights (for example, to contraception) that arose only in the back half of the 20th century in other words, 4The majority ignores that rejection. See ante, at 5, 13, 36. But it is unequivocal: The Glucks berg test, Obergefell said, may have been appropriate in considering physician as sis ted suicide, but is inconsistent with the approach this Court has used in discussing other fundamental rights, including marriage and intimacy. 576 U. S. ,at 671. 18 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting that it is happy to pick and choose, in accord with individual preferences. See ante, at 32, 66, 7172; ante, at 10 (KAVANAUGH ,J. ,concurring); but see ante, at 3 (THOMAS ,J. ,concurring). But that is a matter we discuss later. See infra ,at 2429. For now, our point is different: It is that applications of liberty and equality can evolve while remaining grounded in constitutional principles, constitutional history, and constitutional precedents. The second Justice Harl an discussed how to strike the right balance when he explained why he would have invalidated a States ban on contraceptive use. Judges, he said, are not free to roam where unguided speculation might take them. Poe v. Ull man , 367 U. S. 497, 542 (1961) (dissenting opinion). Yet they also must recognize that the constitutional tradition of this country is not captured whole at a single moment. Ibid. Rather, its meaning gains content from the long sweep of our history and from successive judicial precedents each looking to the last and each seeking to apply the Constitutions most fundamental commitments to new conditions. That is why Americans, to go back to Oberge fells example, have a right to marry across racial lines. And it is why, to go back to Justice Harl ans case, Americans have a right to use contraceptives so they can choose for themselves whether to have children. All that is what Ca sey understood. Ca sey explicitly rejected the present majoritys method. [T]he specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, Ca sey stated, do not mark[ ]the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. 505 U. S. ,at 848. 5 To hold other wi seas the majority does today would be inconsistent 5In a perplexing paragraph in its opinion, the majority declares that it need not say whether that statement from Ca sey is true. See ante, at 32 33. But how could that be? Has not the majority insisted for the prior 30 or so pages that the specific practice[ ]respecting abortion at the 19 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting with our law. Id. ,at 847. Why? Because the Court has vindicated [the] principle over and over that (no matter the sentiment in 1868) there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter especially relating to bodily integrity and family life. Id. ,at 847, 849, 851. Ca sey described in detail the Courts contraception cases. See id. ,at 848849, 851853. It noted decisions protecting the right to marry, including to someone of another race. See id. ,at 847848 ([I]nterracial marriage was illegal in most States in the 19th century, but the Court was no doubt correct in finding it to be an aspect of liberty protected against state interference). In reviewing decades and dec ades of constitutional law, Ca sey could draw but one conclusion: Whatever was true in 1868, [i]t is settled now, as i twas when the Court heard arguments in Roe v. Wade ,that the Constitution places limits on a States right to interfere with a persons most basic decisions about family and parenthood. Id. ,at 849. And that conclusion still held good, until the Courts intervention here. It was settled at the time of Roe, settled at the time of Ca sey ,and settled yesterday that the Constitution places limits on a States power to assert control over an individuals body and most personal decision making. A multitude of decisions supporting that principle led to Roes recognition and Ca sey s reaffirmation of the right to choose; and Roe and Ca sey in turn supported additional protections for intimate and familial relations. The majority has em time of precludes its recognition as a constitutional right? Ante ,at 33. It has. And indeed, it has given no other reason for overruling Roe and Ca sey Ante ,at 1516. We are not min d readers, but here is our best guess as to what the majority means. It says next that [a]bortion is nothing new. Ante ,at 33. So apparently, the Fourteenth Amendment might provide protection for things wholly unknown in the 19th century; maybe one day there could be constitutional protection for, oh, time travel But as to anything that was known back then (such as abortion or contraception), no such luck. 20 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting barras singly little to say about those precedents. It (liter ally) rattles them off in a single paragraph; and it implies that they have nothing to do with each other, or with the right to terminate an early pregnancy. See ante, at 3132 (asserting that recognizing a relationship among them, as addressing aspects of personal autonomy, would ineluctably license fundamental rights to illegal drug use [and] prostitution). But that is flat wrong. The Courts precedents about bodily autonomy, sexual and familial relations, and procreation are all interwoven all part of the fabric of our constitutional law, and because that is so, of our lives. Especially womens lives, where they safeguard a right toselfdetermination. And eliminating that right, we need to say before further describing our precedents, is not taking a neutral position, JUSTICE KAVANAUGH tries to argue. Ante ,at 23, 5, 7, 1112 (concurring opinion). His idea is that neutrality lies in giving the abortion issue to the States, where some can go one way and some another. But would he say that the Court is being scrupulously neutral if it allowed New York and California to ban all the guns they want? Ante ,at 3. If the Court allowed some States to use unanimous juries and other s not? If the Court told the States: Decide for yourselves whether to put res restrictions on church attend attendance? We could go on and in fact we will. Suppose J US TICE KAVANAUGH were to say (in line with the majority opinion) that the rights we just listed are more textually or historically grounded than the right to choose. What, then, of the right to contraception or same sex marriage? Would it be scrupulously neutral for the Court to eliminate those rights too? The point of all these examples is that when it comes to rights, the Court does not act neutrally when it leaves everything up to the St ates. Rather, the Court acts neutrally when it protects the right against all comers. And to apply that point to the ca se here: When the Court decimates a right women have held for 50 years, the Court is 21 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting not being scrupulously neutral. It is instead taking sides: against women who wish to exercise the right, and for States (like Mississippi) that want to bar them JUSTICE KAVANAUGH cannot obscure that point by appropriating the rhetoric of ev evenhandedness. His position just is what it is: A brooknocompromise refusal to recognize a womans right to choose, from the first day of a pregnancy. And that position, as we will now show, cannot be squared with this Courts longstanding view that women indeed have rights (whatever the state of the world in 1868) to make the most personal and consequential decisions about their bodies and their lives. Consider first, then, the line of this Courts cases protecting bodily integrity. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 849. No right, in this Courts time honored view, is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person. Union Pacific R. Co. v. Bots ford , 141 U. S. 250, 251 (1891); see Cr uzan v. Director, Mo. De pt. Health, 497 U. S. 261, 269 (1990) (Every adult has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body). Or to put it more simply: Everyone, including women, owns their own bodies. So the Court has restricted the power of go government to interfere with a persons medical decisions or compel her to undergo medical procedures or treatments. See, e. g. g., Wins ton v. Lee, 470 U. S. 753, 766767 (1985) (forced surgery); Ro chin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 166, 173174 (1952) (forced stomach pumping); Washington v. Harper Harper, 494 U. S. 210, 229, 236 (1990) (forced administration of antipsychotic drugs). Ca sey recognized the doctrinal affinity between those precedents and Roe. 505 U. S. ,at 857. And that doctrinal affinity is born of a factual likeness. There are few greater incursions on a body than forcing a woman to complete a pregnancy and give birth. For every woman, those experiences involve all manner of physical changes, medical treatments (including the possibility of a cesarean section), and 22 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting medical risk. Just as one example, an American woman is 14 times more likely to die by carrying a pregnancy to term than by having an abortion. See Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt , 579 U. S. 582, 618 (2016). That women happily undergo those burdens and hazards of their own accord does not lessen how far a State impinges on a womans body when it compels her to bring a pregnancy to term. And for some women, as Roe recognized, abortions are medically necessary to prevent harm. See 410 U. S. ,at 153. The majority does not say which is itself ominous whether a State may prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion when she and her doctor have determined it is a needed medical treatment. So too, Roe and Ca sey fit neatly into a long line of decisions protecting from government intrusion a wealth of private choices about family matters, child rearing, intimate relationships, and procreation. See Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 851, 857; Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 152153; see also ante, at 3132 (listing the myriad decisions of this kind that Ca sey relied on). Those cases safeguard particular choices about whom to marry; whom to have sex with; what family members to live with; how to raise children and crucially, whether and when to have children. In varied cases, the Court explained that those choices the most intimate and personal a person can make reflect fundamental aspects of personal identity; they define the very attributes of personhood. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 851. And they inevitably shape the nature and future course of a persons life (and often the lives of those closest to her). So, the Court held, those choices belong to the individual, and not the government. That is the essence of what liberty requires. And liberty may require it, this Court has repeatedly said, even when those living in 1868 would not have recognized the claim because they would not have seen the per son making it as a full fledged member of the community. Throughout our history, the sphere of protected liberty has 23 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting expanded, bringing in individuals formerly excluded. In that way, the constitutional values of liberty and equality go hand in hand; they do not inhabit the hermetically sealed containers the majority portrays. Compare Obergefell , 576 U. S. ,at 672675, with ante, at 1011. So before Roe and Ca sey ,the Court expanded in successive cases those who could claim the right to marry though their relationships would have been outside the laws protection in Loving, 388 U. S. 1 (interracial couples); Turner v. Sa fley , 482 U. S. 78 (1987) (prisoners); see also, e. g. ,Stanley v. Illinois Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 651652 (1972) (offering constitutional protection to untraditional family unit[s]). And after Roe and Ca sey ,of course, the Court continued in that vein. With a critical stop to hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protected same sex intimacy, the Court resolved that the Amendment also conferred on same sex couples the right to marry. See Lawrence, 539 U. S. 558; Obergefell, 576 U. S. 644. In considering that question, the Court held, [h]istory and tradition, especially as reflected in the course of our precedent, guide and discipline [the] inquiry. Id. ,at 664. But the sentiments of 1868 alone do not and cannot rule the present. Ibid. Ca sey similarly recognized the need to extend the constitutional sphere of liberty to a previously excluded group. The Court then understood, as the majority today does not, that the men who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and wrote the state laws of the time did not view women as full and equal citizens. See supra, at 15. A woman then, Ca sey wrote, had no legal existence separate from her husband. 505 U. S. ,at 897. Women were seen only as the center of home and family life, without full and independent legal status under the Constitution. Ibid. But that could not be true any longer: The State could not now insist on the historically dominant vision of the womans role. Id. ,at 852. And equal citizenship, Ca sey realized, was inescapably con 24 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting nec ted to reproductive rights. The ability of women to participate equally in the life of the Nation in all its economic, social, political, and legal aspects has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. Id. ,at 856. Without the ability to decide whether and when to have children, women could no tin the way men took for granted determine how they would live their lives, and how they would contribute to the society around them. For much that reason, Ca sey made clear that contraception. Over the course of three cases, the Court had held that a right to use and gain access to contraception was part of the Fourteenth Amendments guarantee of liberty. See Gris wold, 381 U. S. 479; Eisenstadt , 405 U. S. 438; Car ey v. Population Services In tl, 431 U. S. 678 (1977). That clause, we explained, necessarily conferred a right to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child. Eisenstadt , 405 U. S. ,at 453; see Car ey , 431 U. S. ,at 684685. Ca sey saw Roe as of a piece: In critical respects the abortion decision is of the same character. 505 U. S. ,at 852. [R]easonable people, the Court noted, could also oppose contraception; and indeed, they could believe that some forms of contraception similarly implicate a concern with potential life. Id. ,at 853, 859. Yet the views of other s could not automatically prevail against a womans control her own body and make her own choice about whether to bear, and probably to raise, a child. When an unplanned pregnancy is involved because either contraception or abortion is outlawed the liberty of the woman is at stake in a sense unique to the human condition. Id. ,at 852. No State could undertake to resolve the moral questions raised in such a definitive way as to deprive a woman of all choice. Id. ,at 850. Faced with all these connections between RoeCasey and judicial decisions recognizing other constitutional rights, 25 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting the majority tells everyone not to worry. It can (so it says) neatly extract the right to choose from the constitutional edifice without affecting any associated rights. (Think of someone telling you that the Jenga tower simply will not collapse. )Todays decision, the majority first says, does not undermine the decisions cited by Roe and Ca sey the ones involving marriage, procreation, contraception, [and ]family relationship sin any way. Ante ,at 32; Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 851. Note that this first assurance does not extend to rights recognized after Roe and Ca sey ,and partly based on t hemin particular, rights to same sex intimacy and marriage. See supra, at 23. 6 On its later tries, though, the majority includes those too: Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not con cern abortion. Ante ,at 66; see ante ,at 7172. That right is unique, the majority asserts, because [abortion] terminates life or potential life. Ante ,at 66 (internal quotation marks omitted); see ante, at 32, 7172. So the majority depicts todays decision as a restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only. Smith v. All wright , 321 U. S. 649, 669 (1944) (Roberts, J. ,dissenting). Should the audience for these toomuchrepeated protestations be satisfied? We think not. The first problem with the majoritys account comes from J JUSTICE THOMAS s concurrence which makes clear he is not with the program. In saying that nothing in todays opinion casts doubt on non abortion JUSTICE THOMAS explains, he means only that they are not at issue 6And note, too, that the author of th e majority opinion recently joined a statement, written by another member of the majority, lamenting that Obergefell deprived States of the ability to resolve th[e] question [ofsamesex marriage] through legislation. Davis v. Er mold , 592 U. S. S., (2020) (statement of T THOMAS ,J. )(slip o p. ,at 1). That might sound familiar. Cf. ante, at 44 (lamenting that Roe short circuited the demo democratic process). And those two Justices hardly seemed content to let the matter rest: The Court, they said, had created a problem that only it can fix. Davis Davis, 592 U. S. ,at (slip o p. ,at 4). 26 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting in this very case. See ante, at 7 ([T]his case does not present the opportunity to reject those precedents). But he lets us know what he wants to do when they are. [I]n future cases, he says, we should reconsider all of this Courts substantive due process precedents, including Gris wold ,Lawrence ,and Obergefell. Ante ,at 3; see also supra ,at 25, and n. 6. And when we reconsider them? Then we have a duty to overrul[e] these demonstrably erroneous decisions. Ante ,at 3. So at least one Justice is planning to use the ticket of todays decision again and again and again. Even placing the concurrence to the side, the assurance in todays opinion still does not work. Or at least that is so if the majority is serious about its sole reason for overturn ing Roe and Ca sey :the legal status of abortion in the 19th century. Except in the places quoted above, the state interest in protecting fetal life plays no part in the majoritys analysis. To the contrary, the majority takes pride in not expressing a view about the status of the fetus. Ante ,at 65; see ante, at 32 (aligning itself with Roes and Ca sey s stance of not deciding whether life or potential life is involved); ante, at 3839 (similar). The majoritys departure from Roe and Ca sey rests instead and on lyon whether a womans decision to end a pregnancy involves any Fourteenth Amendment liberty interest (against which Roe and Ca sey balanced the state interest in preserving fetal life). 7 7Indulge a few more words about this point. The majority had a choice of two different ways to overrule Roe and Ca sey. It could claim that those cases underrated the States interest in fetal life. Or it could claim that they overrated a womans constitution al liberty interest in choosing an abortion. (Or both. )The majority here rejects the first path, and we can see why. Taking that route would have prevented the majority from claiming that it means only to le ave this issue to the democratic process that it does not have a dog in the fight. See ante ,at 3839, 65. And indeed, doing so might have suggested a revolutionary proposition: that the fetus is itself a constitution ally protected person, such that an abortion ban is constitutionally mandated. The majority therefore chooses the second path, arguing th at the Fourteenth Amendment does 27 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting According to the majority, no liberty interest is present because (and only because) the law offered no protection to the womans choice in the 19th century. But here is the rub. The law also did not then (and would not for ages) protect a wealth of other things. It did not protect the rights recognized in Lawrence and Obergefell to same sex intimacy and marriage. It did not protect the right recognized in Loving to marry across racial lines. It did not protect the right recognized in Gris wold to contraceptive use. For that matter, it did not protect the right recognized in Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williams on , 316 U. S. 535 (1942), not to be sterilized without consent. So if the majority is right in its legal analysis, all those decisions were wrong, and all those matters properly belong to the States too whatever the particular state interests involved. And if that is true, it is impossible to understand (as a matter of logic and principle) how the majority can say that its opinion today does not threaten does not even undermine any number of other constitutional rights. Ante ,at 32. 8 Nor does it even help just to take the majority at its word. Assume the majority is sincere in saying, for whatever reason, that it will go so far and no further. Scouts honor. Still, the future significance of todays opinion will be decided in the future. And law often has a way of evolving not conceive of the abortion decision as implicating liberty, because the law in the 19th century gave that choice no protection. The trouble is that the chosen path which is, again, the solitary rationale for the Courts decision provides no way to distinguish between the right to choose an abortion and a range of other rights, including contraception. 8The majority briefly (very briefly) gestures at the idea that some stare dec isis factors might play out differently with respect to these other constitutional rights. But the majority gives no hint as to why. And the majoritys (mis)treatment of stare dec isis in this case provides little rea son to think that the doctrine would stand as a barrier to the majority s considered egregiously wrong. See infra ,at 3057. 28 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting without regard to original intention sa way of actually following where logic leads, rather than tolerating hard to explain lines. Rights can expand in that way. Dissenting in Lawrence ,Justice Scalia explained why he took no comfort in the Courts statement that a decision recognizing the right to same sex intimacy did not involve same sex marriage. 539 U. S. ,at 604. That could be true, he wrote, only if one entertains the belief that principle and logic have nothing decisions of this Court. Id. ,at 605. Score one for the dissent, as a matter of prophecy. And logic and principle are not one way ratchets. Rights can contract in the same way and for the same reason because whatever todays majority might say, one thing really does lead to another. We fervently ho pe that does not happen be cause of todays decision. We hope that we will not join Justice Scalia in the book of prophets. But we cannot understand how anyone can be confident that todays opinion will be the last of its kind. Consider, as our last word on this issue, contraception. The Constitution, of course, does not mention that word. And there is no historical right to contraception, of the kind the majority insists on. To the contrary, the American legal landscape in the decades after the Civil War was littered with bans on the sale of contraceptive devices. So again, there seem to be two choices. See supra ,at 5, 2627. If the majority is serious about its historical approach, then Gris wold and its progeny are in the line of fire too. Or if it is not serious, then what is the basis of todays decision? If we had to guess, we suspect the prospects of this Court approving bans on contraception are low. But once again, the future significance of todays opinion will be decided in the future. At the least, todays opinion will fuel the fight to get contraception, and any other issues with a moral dimension, out of the Fourteenth Amendment and into state 29 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting legislatures. 9 Anyway, todays decision, taken on its own, is catastrophic enough. As a matter of constitutional method, the majoritys commitment to replicate in 2022 every view about the meaning of liberty held in 1868 has precious little to recommend it. Our law in th is constitutional sphere, as in most, has for decades upon decades proceeded differently. It has considered fundamental constitutional principles, the whole course of the Nations history and traditions, and the stepbystep evolution of the Courts precedents. It is disciplined but not static. It relies on accumulated judgments, not just the sentiments of one long ago generation of men (who themselves believed, and drafted the Constitution to reflect, that the world progresses). And by doing so, it includes those excluded from that olden conversation, rather than perpetuating its bounds. As a matter of constitutional substance, the majoritys opinion has all the flaws its method would suggest. Because laws in 1868 deprived women of any control over their bodies, the majority approves States doing so today. Be cause those laws prevented women from charting the course of their own lives, the majority says States can do the same again. Because in 1868, the government could tell a pregnant woman even in the first days of her pregnancy that she could do nothing but bear a child, it can once more impose that command Todays decision strips women of agency over what ev en the majority agrees is a 9As this Court has considered this case, some state legislators have begun to call for restrictions on certain forms of contraception.

Even before we get to stare dec isis ,we dissent. II By overruling Roe, Ca sey ,and more than 20 cases reaffirming or applying the constitutional right to abortion, the majority abandons stare dec isis ,a principle central to the rule decided. Blacks Law Dictionary 1696 (11th ed. 2019). Black stone called it the established rule to abide by former precedents. 1 Black stone 69. Stare dec isis promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles. Pay ne , 501 U. S. ,at 827.

Stare dec isis also contributes to the integrity of our constitutional system of government by ensuring that decisions are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals. Vasquez , 474 U. S. ,at 265. As Hamilton wrote: It avoid[s] an arbitrary discretion in the courts. The Federalist No. 78, p. 529 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). And as Black stone said before him: It keep[s] the scale of justice even and steady, and not liable to waver with every new judges opinion. 1 B l ackstone 69. The glory of our legal system is that it gives preference to precedent rather than jurists. H. Humble, Departure From Precedent, 19 M ich. L. Rev. 608, 614 (1921). That is why, the story goes, Chief Justice John Marshall donned a plain black robe when he swore the oath of office. That act personified an American tradition. Judges personal preferences do not make law; rather, the law speaks through 31 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting them. That means the Court may not overrule a decision, even a constitutional one, without a special States, 587 U. S. S., (2019) (slip o p. ,at 11). Stare dec isis is, of course, not an inexorable command; it is sometimes appropriate to overrule an earlier decision. Pe arson v. Calla han , 555 U. S. 223, 233 (2009). But the Court must have a good reason to do so over and above the belief that the precedent was wrongly decided. Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., 573 U. S. 258, 266 (2014). [I]t is not alone sufficient that we would decide a case differently now than we did then. Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC , 576 U. S. 446, 455 (2015). The majority today lists some 30 of our cases as overruling precedent, and argues that they support overruling Roe and Ca sey But none does, as further described below and in the Appendix. See infra ,at 6166. In some, the Court only partially modified or clarified a precedent. And in the rest, the Court relied on one or more of the traditional stare dec isis factors in reaching its conclusion. The Court found, for example, (1) a change in legal doctrine that undermined or made obsolete the earlier decision; (2) a factual change that had the same effect; or (3) an absence of reliance because the earlier decision was less than a decade old. (The majority is wrong when it says that we insist on a test of changed law or fact alone, although that is present in most of the cases. See ante, at 69. )None of those factors apply here: Nothing and in particular, no significant legal or factual change supports overturning a half century of settled law giving women control over their reproductive lives. First, for all the reasons we have given, Roe and Ca sey were correct. In holding that a State could not resolve the debate about abortion in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in th e matter, the Court protected womens liberty and womens e quality in a way comporting with our Fourteenth Amendment precedents. Ca sey , 505 32 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting U. S. ,at 850. Contrary to the majoritys view, the legal status of abortion in the 19th century does not weaken those decisions. And the majoritys repeated refrain about usurp[ing] state legislatures power to address a publicly contested question does not help it on the key issue here. Ante ,at 44; see ante, at 1. To repeat: The point of a right is to shield individual actions and decisions from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. Barnette , 319 U. S. ,at 638; supra, at 7. However divisive, a right is not at the peoples mercy. In any event [w]hether or no t we agree with a prior precedent is the beginning, not the end, of our analysis and the remaining principles of stare dec isis weigh heavily against overruling Roe and Ca sey Dicker son v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000). Ca sey itself applied those principles, in one of this Courts most important precedents about precedent. After assessing the traditional stare de ci sis factors, Ca sey reached the only conclusion possible that stare dec isis operates powerfully here. It still does. The standards Roe and Ca sey set out are perfectly workable. No changes in either law or fact have eroded the two decisions. And tens of millions of American women have relied, and continue to rely, on the right to choose. So under traditional stare dec isis principles, the majority has no special justification for the harm it causes. And indeed, the majority comes close to conceding that point. The majority barely mentions any legal or factual changes that have occurred since Roe and Ca sey It suggests that the two decisions are hard for courts to implement, but cannot prove its case. In the end, the majority says, all it must say to override stare dec isis is one thing: that it believes Roe and Ca sey egregiously wrong. Ante ,at 70. That rule could equally spell the end of any precedent with which a bare majority of the present Court disagrees. 33 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting So how does that approach prevent the scale of justice from waver[ing] with every new judges opinion? 1 Black stone 69. It does not. It makes radical change too easy and too fast, based on nothing more than the new views of new judges. The majority has overruled Roe and Ca sey for one and only one reason: because it has always despised the m,and now it has the votes to discard them. The majority thereby substitutes a rule by judges for the rule of law. A Contrary to the majoritys view, there is nothing unworkable about Ca sey s undue burden standard. Its primary focus on whether a State has placed a substantial obstacle on a woman seeking an S., (2020) (slip o p. ,at 6) (R (ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring in judgment). And it has given rise to no more conflict in application than many standards this Court and other s unhesitatingly apply every day. General standards, like the undue burden standard, are ubiquitous in the law, and particularly in constitutional adjudication. When called on to give effect to the Constitutions broad principles, this Court often crafts flexible standards that can be applied casebycase to a myriad of unforeseeable circumstances. See Dicker son, 530 U. S. ,at 441 (No court laying down a ge general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which it must apply). So, for example, the Court asks about undue or substantial burdens on speech, on voting, and on interstate commerce. See, e. g. ,Arizona Free Enterprise Clubs Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, 564 U. S. 721, 748 (2011); Bur dick v. Takushi , 504 U. S. 428, 433434 (1992); Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc. Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970). The Ca sey undue burden standard is the same. It also resembles general standards that courts 34 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting work with daily in other legal spheres like the rule of reason in antitrust law or the arbitrary and capricious standard for agency decision making. See Standard Oil Co. of N. J. v. States, 221 U. S. 1, 62 (1911); Motor Vehicle M frs. As sn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Automobile Ins. Co. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 4243 (1983). Applying general standards to particular cases is, in many contexts, just what it means to do law. And the undue burden standard has given rise to no unusual difficulties. Of course, it has provoked some disagreement among judges. Ca sey knew it would: That much is to be expected in the application of any legal standard which must accommodate lifes complexity. 505 U. S. ,at 878 (plurality opinion). Which is to say: That much is to be expected in the application of any legal standard. But majority vastly overstates the di visions among judges applying the standard. We count essentially two. T HE CHIEF JUSTICE disagreed with other Justices in the June Medical majority about whether Ca sey called for weighing the benefits of an abortion regulation against its burdens. See 591 U. S. ,at (slip o p. ,at 67); ante, at 59, 60, and n. 53. 10 We agree that the June Medical difference is a difference but not one that would actually make a difference in the result of most cases (it did not in June Medical ),and not one incapable of resolution were it ever to matter. As for lower courts, there is now a oneyearold, onetoone Circuit split about how the undue burden standard applies to state laws that ban abortions for certain reasons, like fetal abnormality. See ante, at 61, and n. 57. That is about it, as far as we can see. 11 And that is not much. This Court 10Some lower courts then differed over which opinion in June Medical was controlling but that is a dispute not about the undue burden standard, but about the Marks rule, which tells courts how to determine the precedential effects of a divided decision. 11The rest of the majoritys supposed splits are, shall we say, u nim 35 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting mostly does not even grant certiorari on oneyearold, onetoone Circuit splits, because we know that a bit of disagreement is an inevitable part of our legal system. To borrow an old saying that might apply here: Not one or even a couple of swallows can make the majoritys summer. Anyone concerned about workability should consider the majoritys substitute standard. The majority says a law regulating or banning abortion must be sustained if the reis a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests. Ante ,at 77. And the majority lists interests like respect for and preservation of prenatal life, protection of maternal health, elimination of certain medical procedures, mitigation of fetal pain, and other s. Ante ,at 78. This Court will surely face critical questions about how that test applies. Must a state law allow abortions when necessary to protect a womans life and health? And if so, exactly when? How much risk to a womans life can a State force pressive. The majority says that lower courts have split over how to apply the undue burden standard to parental notification laws. See ante, at 60, and n. 54. But that is not so. The state law upheld had an exemption for minors demonstrating adequate maturity, whereas the ones struck down did not. Compare Planned Parenthood of Blue Ridge v. Camblos ,155 F. 3d 352, 383384 (CA4 1998), with Planned Parenthood of I nd. Ky. ,Inc. v. Adams Adams, 937 F. 3d 973, 981 (CA7 2019), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 591 U. S. (2020), and Planned Parenthood, Sioux Falls Clinic v. Miller ,63 F. 3d 1452, 1460 (CA8 1995). The majority says there is a split about bans on certain types of abortion procedures. See ante, at 61, and n. 55. But the one court to have separated itself on that issue did so based on a set of factual findings significantly different from those in other cases. Compare Whole Womans Health v. Paxton ,10 F. 4th 430, 447453 (CA5 2021), with EM W Womens Surgical Center, P. S. C. v. Fried lander, 960 F. 3d 785, 798806 (CA6 2020), and West Ala. Womens Center v. Williams on , 900 F. 3d 1310, 13221324 (CA11 2018). Finally, the majority says there is a split about whether an increase in travel time to reach a clinic is an undue burden. See ante, at 61, and n. 56. But the cases to which the ma majority refers predate this Court s decision in Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt , 579 U. S. 582 (2016), which clarified how to apply the undue burden standard to that context. 36 DO BBS v.

Further, the Court may face questions about the application of abortion regulations to medical care most people view as quite different from abortion. What about the morning after pill? IUDs? In vitro fertilization? And how about the use of dilation and evacuation or medication for miscarriage management? See generally L. Harris, Navigating Loss of Abortion Service sA Large Academic Medical Center Prepares for the Overturn of Roe v. Wade, 386 New England J.

The Constitution protects travel and speech and interstate commerce, so todays ruling will give rise to a host of new constitutional questions. Far from removing the Court from the abortion issue, the majority puts the Court at the center of the coming inter jurisdictional abortion wars. Id. ,at (draft, at 1). In short, the majority does not save judges from unwieldy tests or extricate them from the sphere of controversy. To the contrary, it discards a known, workable, and predictable standard in favor of something novel and probably far more complicated. It forces th e Court to wade further into hotly contested issues, including moral and philosophical ones, that the majority criticizes Roe and Ca sey for addressing. B When overruling constitutional precedent, the Court has almost always pointed to major legal or factual changes un undermining a decisions original basis. A review of the Appendix to this dissent proves the point. See infra ,at 6166. Most successful proponent[s] of overruling precedent, this Court once said, have carried the heavy burden of persuading the Court that changes in society or in the law dictate that the values served by stare dec isis yield in favor of a greater objective. Vasquez, 474 U. S. ,at 266. Certainly, that was so of the main examples the majority cites: Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), and West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish ,300 U. S. 379 (1937). But it is not so today. Although nodding to some arguments other s have made about modern developments, the majority does not really rely on them, no doubt seeing their slimness. Ante ,at 33; see ante, at 34. The majority briefly invokes the cur rent controversy over abortion. See ante, at 7071. But it has to acknowledge that the same dispute has existed for 38 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting decades: Conflict over abortion is not a change but a constant. (And as we will later discuss, the presence of that continuing division provides more of a reason to stick with ,than to jettison, existing precedent. See infra ,at 5557. )In the end, the majority throws longstanding precedent to the winds without showing that anything significant has changed to justify its radical reshaping of the law. See ante, at 43. 1 Subsequent legal developments have only reinforced Roe and Ca sey The Court has continued to embrace all decisions Roe and Ca sey cited, decisions which recognize a constitutional right for an individual to make her own choices about intimate relationships, the family, and contraception. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 857. Roe and Ca sey have themselves formed the legal foundation for subsequent decisions protecting these profoundly personal choices. As discussed earlier, the Court relied on Ca sey to hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protects same sex Lawrence, 539 U. S. ,at 578; supra, at 23. The Court later invoked the same set of precedents to accord constitutional recognition to same sex marriage. See Obergefell, 576 U. S. ,at 665666; supra, at 23. In sum, Roe and Ca sey are inextricably interwoven with decades of precedent about the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. See supra, at 2124. While the majority might wish it otherwise, Roe and Ca sey are the very opposite of obsolete constitutional thinking. Agostini v. Felt on , 521 U. S. 203, 236 (1997) (quoting Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 857). Moreover, no subsequent factual developments have undermined Roe and Ca sey Women continue to experience unplanned pregnancies and unexpected developments in pregnancies. Pregnancies continue to have enormous physical, social, and economic consequences. Even an uncompli 39 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting cated pregnancy imposes significant strain on the body, unavoidably involving significant physiological change and excruciating pain. For some women, pregnancy and childbirth can mean life altering physical ailments or even death. Today, as noted earlier, the risks of carrying a pregnancy to term dwarf those of having an abortion. See supra, at 22. Experts estimate that a ban on abortions increases maternal mortality by 21 percent, with white women facing a 13 percent increase in maternal mortality while black women face a 33 percent increase. 13 Pregnancy and childbirth may also impose large scale financial costs. The majority briefly refers to relating to healthcare coverage, pregnancy discrimination, and family leave. See ante, at 3334. Many women, however, still do not have adequate healthcare coverage before and after pregnancy; and, even when insurance coverage is available, healthcare services may be far away. 14 Women also continue to face pregnancy discrimination that interferes with their ability to earn a living. Paid family leave remains inaccessible to many who need it most. Only 20 percent of private sector workers have access to paid family leave, including a mere 8 percent of workers in the bottom 13See L. Harris, Navigating Loss of Abortion Service sA Large Academic Medical Center Prepares for the Overturn of Roe v. Wade, 386 New England J. Med. 2061, 2063 (2022). This projected racial disparity reflects existing differences in maternal mortality rates for black and white women. Black women are now three to four times more likely to die during or after childbirth than white women, often from preventable causes.

Moreover, the choice to give up parental rights after giving birth is altogether different from the choice not to carry a pregnancy to term. The reality is that few women denied an abortion will choose adoption. 17 The vast majority will continue, just as in Roe and Ca sey s time, to shoulder the costs of child rearing. Whether or not they choose to parent, they will experience the profound loss of autonomy and dignity that coerced pregnancy and birth always i m -pose. 18 15Dept. of Labor, National Compensation Survey: Employee Benefits in the United States, Table 31 (Sept. 2020), https :www. b ls. govncsebsbenefits2020employee-benefits-in- the-united-states-march-2020. pdfpage299. 16Safe haven laws, which allow parents to leave newborn babies in designated safe spaces without threat of prosecution, were not enacted as an alternative to abortion, but in response to rare situations in which birthing mothers in crisis would kill their newborns or leave them to die.

See G. Sis son, L. Ralph, H. Gould, D.

Ante ,at 34. It is hard to know how anyone would evaluate such a claim and as we have described above, the majoritys reasoning does not rely on any reevaluation of the interest in protecting fetal life.

See Brief for 547 Deans 910. We do not say that every State is Mississippi, and we are sure some have made gains since Roe and Ca sey in providing support for women and children. But a statebystate analysis by public health professionals shows that States with the most restrictive abortion policies also continue to invest the least in womens and children s health. See Brief for 547 Deans 2334. The only notable change we can see since Roe and Ca sey cuts in favor of adhering to precedent: It is that American abortion law has become more and more aligned with other nations. The majority, like the Mississippi Legislature, claims that the United States is an extreme outlier when it comes to abortion regulation. See ante, at 6, and n. 15. The global trend, however, has been toward increased provision of legal and safe abortion care. A number of countries, including New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Iceland, permit abortions up to a roughly similar time as Roe and Ca sey set.

They also typically make access to early abortion easier, for example, by helping cover its cost. 21 Perhaps most notable, more than 50 countries around the world in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Europe have expanded access to abortion in the past 25 years. See Brief for Inter national and Comparative Legal Scholars as Ami ci Curiae 2829. In light of that worldwide liberalization of abortion laws, it is American States that will become international outliers after today. In sum, the majority can point to neither legal nor factual developments in support of its decision. Nothing that has happened in this country or the world in recent decades undermines the core insight of Roe and Ca sey It continues to be true that, within the constraints those decisions established, a woman, not the government, should choose whether she will bear the burdens of pregnancy, childbirth ,and parenting. 2 In support of its holding, see ante, at 40, the majority invokes two watershed cases overruling prior constitutional precedents: West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish and Brown v. Board of Education But those decisions, unlike todays, responded to changed law and to changed facts and attitudes that had taken hold throughout society. As Ca sey recognized, the two cases are relevant only to show by stark contras thow unjustified overturning the right to choose is. See 505 U. S. ,at 861864. West Coast Hotel overruled Ad kins v. Children s Hospital 21See D. Gross man, K. Grind lay, B. Burns, Public Funding for Abortion Where Broadly Legal, 94 Contraception 451, 458 (2016) (discussing funding of abortion in European countries). 44 DO BBS v. C., 261 U. S. 525 (1923), and a whole line of cases be ginning with Lochner v. New York York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). Ad kins had found a state minimum wage law unconstitutional because, in the Courts view, the law interfered with a constitutional right to contract. 261 U. S. ,at 554555. But then the Great Depression hit, bringing with it unparalleled economic despair. The experience undermine din fact, it disprovedAdkins s assumption that a wholly unregulated market could meet basic human needs. As Justice Jackson (before becoming a Justice) wrote of that time: The older world of laissez f aire was recognized everywhere outside the Court to be dead. The Struggle for Judicial Supremacy 85 (1941). In West Coast Hotel, the Court caught up, recognizing through the lens of experience the flaws of existing legal doctrine. See also ante ,at (ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring in judgment). The havoc the Depression had worked on ordinary Americans, the Court noted, was common knowledge through the length and breadth of the land. 300 U. S. ,at 399. The laissezfaire approach had led to the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insufficient to meet the bare cost of living. Ibid. And since Ad kins was decided, the law had also changed. In several decisions, the Court had started to recognize the power of States to implement economic policies designed to enhance their citizens economic wellbeing. See, e. g. g., Nebbia v. New York York, 291 U. S. 502 (1934); OGorman Young, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. Co., 282 U. S. 251 (1931). The state statements in those decisions, West Coast Hotel explained, were impossible to reconcile with Ad kins 300 U. S. ,at 398. There was no escaping the need for Ad kins to go. Brown v. Board of Education overruled Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), along with its doctrine of separate but equal. By 1954, decades of Ji m Crow had made clear what Plessy s turn of phrase actually meant: inherent[ ][in]equal[ity]. Brown Brown, 347 U. S. ,at 495. Segregation 45 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting was not, and could not ever be, consistent with the Reconstruction Amendments, ratified to give the former slaves full citizenship. Whatever might have been thought in Plessy s time, the Brown Court explained, both experience and modern authority showed the detrimental effect[s ]of state sanctioned segregation: It affect[ed] [children s] hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone. 347 U. S. ,at 494. By that point, too, the law had begun to reflect that understanding. In a series of decisions, the Court had held unconstitutional public graduate schools exclusion of black students. See, e. g. g., Sweat t v. Painter Painter, 339 U. S. 629 (1950); Sipuel v. Board of Regents of Un iv. of Ok la. , 332 U. S. 631 (1948) (per curia m );Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U. S. 337 (1938). The logic of those cases, Brown held, appl[ied] with added force to children in grade and high schools. 347 U. S. ,at 494. Changed facts and changed law required Plessy s end. The majority says that in recognizing those changes, we are implicitly supporting the half century interlude between Plessy and Brown See ante ,at 70. That is not so. First, if the Brown Court had used the majoritys method of constitutional construction, it might not ever have overruled Plessy ,whether 5 or 50 or 500 years later. Brown thought that whether the ratification era history supported desegregation was [a]t best inconclusive. 347 U. S. ,at 489. But even setting that aside, we are not saying that a decision can never be overruled just because it is terribly wrong. Take West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, which the majority also relies on. See ante, at 4041, 70. That overruling took place just three years after the initial decision, before any notable reliance interests had developed. It happened as well because individual Justices changed their minds, not because a new majority wanted to undo the decisions of their predecessors. Both Barnette and Brown ,moreover, share another feature setting them apart from the Courts ruling today. They protected individual 46 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting rights with a strong basis in the Constitutions most fundamental commitments; they did not, as the majority does here, take away a right that individuals have held, and relied on, for 50 years. To take that action based on a new and bare majoritys declaration that two Courts got the result egregiously wrong? And to justify that action by reference to Barnette ?Or to Brown a case in which the Chief Justice also wrote an (11-page) opinion in which the entire Court could speak with one voice? These questions answer themselves. Ca sey itself addressed both West Coast Hotel and Brown ,and found that neither supported Roes overruling. In West Coast Hotel, Ca sey explained, the facts of economic life had proved different from th ose previously assumed. 505 U. S. ,at 862. And even though Plessy was wrong the day it was decided, the passage of time had made that ever more clear to ever more citizens: Societys understanding of the facts in 1954 was fundamentally different than in 1896. Id. ,at 863. So the Court needed to reverse course. In constitutional adjudication as elsewhere in life, changed circumstances may impose new obligations. Id. ,at 864. And because such dramatic change had occurred, the public could understand why the Court was acting. [T]he Nation could accept each decision as a response to the Courts constitutional duty. Ibid. But that would not be true of a reversal of Roe [b]ecause neither the factual under pinnings of Roes central holding nor our understanding of it has changed. 505 U. S. ,at 864. That is just as much so today, because Roe and Ca sey continue to reflect, not diverge from, broad trends in American society. It is, of course, true that many Americans, including many women, opposed those decisions when issued and do so now as well. Yet the fact remains: Roe and Ca sey were the product of a profound and ongoing change in womens roles in the latter part of th e 20th century. Only a dozen years before Roe, the Court described women as the center Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) 47 BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting of home and family life, with special responsibilities that precluded their full legal status under the Constitution. Hoy t v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961). By 1973, when the Court decided Roe, fundamental social change was underway regarding the place of women and the law had begun to follow. See Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71, 76 (1971) (recognizing that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits sex based discrimination). By 1992, when the Court decided Ca sey ,the traditional view of a womans role as only a wife and mother was no longer consistent with our understanding of the family, the individual, or the Constitution. 505 U. S. ,at 897; see supra ,at 15, 2324. Under that charter, Ca sey understood, women must take their place as full and equal citizens. And for that to happen, women must have control over their reproductive decisions. Nothing since Ca sey no changed law, no changed fact has undermined that promise. C The reasons for retaining Roe and Ca sey gain further strength from the overwhelming reliance interests those decisions Court adheres to precedent not just for institutional reasons, but because it recognizes that stability in the law is an essential thread in the mantle of protection that the law affords the individual. Florida De pt. of Health and Rehabilitative Se rvs. v. Florida Nursing Home As sn. , 450 U. S. 147, 154 (1981) (Stevens, J. ,concurring). So when overruling precedent [individuals] settled rights and expectations, stare dec isis has added force. Hilt on v. South Carolina Public Rail ways Commn , 502 U. S. 197, 202 (1991). Ca sey understood that to deny individuals reliance on Roe was to refuse to face the fact[s]. 505 U. S. ,at 856. Today the majority refuses to face the facts. The most striking feature of the [majority] is the absence of any serious discussion of how 48 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting its ruling will affect women. Ante ,at 37. By characterizing Ca sey s reliance arguments as generalized assertions about the national psyche, ante, at 64, it reveals how little it knows or cares about women s lives or about the suffering its decision will cause. In Ca sey ,the Court observed that for two decades individuals have organized intimate relationships and made significant life choices in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail. 505 U. S. ,at 856. Over another 30 years, that reliance solidified. For half a century now, in Ca sey s words, [t]he ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. Ibid. ;see supra, at 23 24. Indeed, all women now of childbearing age have grown up expecting that they would be able to avail themselves of Roes and Ca sey s protections. The disruption of overturning Roe and Ca sey will therefore be profound. Abortion is a common medical procedure and a familiar experience in womens lives. About 18 percent of pregnancies in this country end in abortion, and about one quarter of American women will have an abortion before the age of 45. 22 Those numbers reflect the predictable and life changing effects of carrying a pregnancy, giving birth, and becoming a parent. As Ca sey understood, people today rely on their ability to control and time pregnancies when making countless life decisions: where to live, whether and how to invest in education or careers, how to allocate financial resources, and how to approach intimate and family relationships. Women may count on abortion access for when contraception fails. They may count on abortion access for when contraception cannot be used, for 22See CDC, K.

They may count on abortion for when something changes in the midst of a pregnancy, whether it involves family or financial circumstances, unanticipated medical complications, or heartbreaking fetal diagnoses. Taking majority does today, destroys all those individual plans and expectations. In so doing, it diminishes womens opportunities to participate fully and equally in the Nations political, social, and economic life. See Brief for Economists as Ami ci Curiae 13 (showing that abortion availability has large effects on womens education, la bor force participation, occupations, and earnings (footnotes omitted)). The majoritys response to these obvious points exists far from the reality American women actually live. The majority proclaims that reproductive planning could take virtu ally immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions. Ante ,at 64 (quoting Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 856). 23 The facts are: 45 percent of pregnancies in the United States are unplanned. See Brief for 547 Deans 5. Even the most effective contraceptives fail, and effective contraceptives ar e not universally accessible. 24 Not all sexual activity is consensual and not all contraceptive choices are made by the party who risks pregnancy. See Brief for Legal Voice e t al. as Ami ci Curiae 1819. The Mississippi law at issue here, for example, has no exception for rape or incest, even for underage women. Finally, the 23Astoundingly, the majority casts th is statement as a conce[ssion] from Ca sey with which it agree[s]. Ante ,at 64. In fact, Ca sey used this language as part of describing an argument that it rejected See 505 U. S. ,at 856. It is only todays Court that endorses this profoundly mistaken view. 24See Brief for 547 Deans 67 (noting that 51 percent of women who terminated their pregnancies reported using contraceptives during the month in which they conceived); Brief for Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law e t al. as Ami ci Curiae 1214 (explaining financial and geographic barriers to access to effective contraceptives). 50 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting majority ignores, as explained above, that some women decide to have an abortion because their circumstances change during a pregnancy. See supra, at 49. Human bodies care little for hopes and plans. Events can occur after conception, from unexpected medical risks to changes in family circumstances, which profoundly alter what it means to carry a pregnancy to term. In all these situations, women have expected that they will get to decide, perhaps in consultation with their families or doctors but free from state interference, whether to continue a pregnancy. For those who will now have to undergo that pregnancy, the loss of Roe and Ca sey could be disastrous. That is especially so for women without money. When we count[ ]the cost of [Roes] repudiation on women who once relied on that decision, it is not hard to see where the greatest burden will fall. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 855. In States that bar abortion, women of means will still be able to travel to obtain the services they need. 25 It is women who cannot afford to do so who will suffer most. These are the women most likely to seek abortion care in the first place. Women living below the federal poverty line experience unintended pregnancies at rates five times higher than higher income women do, and nearly half of women who seek abortion care live in households below the poverty line. See Brief for 547 Deans 7; Brief for Abortion Funds and Practical Support Organizations as Ami ci Curiae 8 (Brief for Abortion Funds). 25This statement of course assumes that States are not successful in preventing interstate travel to obtain an abortion. See supra ,at 3, 36 37. Even assuming that is so, increased outofstate demand will lead to availability of service in States still providing abortions. See Brief fo r State of California e t al. as Ami ci Curiae 2527. This is what happened in Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Nevada last fall after Texas effectively banned abortions past six weeks of gestation. See United States Texas, 595 U. S. S., (2021) (S OTO MAYOR ,J. ,concurring in part and dissenting in part) (slip o p. ,at 6). 51 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting Even with Roe s protection, these women face immense obstacles to raising the money n needed to obtain abortion care early in their pregnancy. See Brief for Abortion Funds 7 12. 26 After today, in States where legal abortions are not available, they will lose any ability to obtain safe, legal abortion care. They will not have the money to make the trip necessary; or to obtain childcare for that time; or to take time off work. Many will endure the costs and risks of pregnancy and giving birth against their wishes. Other s will turn in desperation to illegal and unsafe abortions. They may lose not just their freedom, but their lives. 27 Finally, the expectation of reproductive control is integral to many womens identity and their place in the Nation. See Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 856. That expectation helps define 26The average cost of a firsttrimeste r abortion is about 500. See Brief for Abortion Funds 7. Federal insurance generally does not cover the cost of abortion, and 35 percent of American adults do not have cash on hand to cover an unexpected expense that high. Guttmacher Institute, M. Donovan, In Real Life: Federal Restrictions on Abortion Coverage and the Women They Impact (Jan. 5, 2017), https :www. guttmacher. orggpr201701real-life-fede ralrestrictionsabortioncoverage -and-women-they-impact::textAlthough20the20Hyde20Amendment20bars,provide20abortion20coverage20to20enrollees; Brief for Abortion Funds 11. 27Mississippi is likely to be one of the States where these costs are highest, though history shows that it will have company. As described above, Mississippi provides only the bar est financial support to pregnant women. See supra ,at 4142. The State will greatly restrict abortion care without addressing any of the financial, health, and family needs that motivate many women to seek it. The effects will be felt most severely, as they always have been, on the bodies of the poor. The history of state abortion restrictions is a history of heavy costs exacted from the most vulnerable women. It is a history of women seeking illegal abortions in hotel rooms and home kitchens; of women trying to self induce abortions by douching with bleach, injecting lye, and penetrating themselves with knitting needles, scissors, and coat hangers. See L. Reagan, When Abortion Was a Crime 4243, 198199, 208209 (1997). It is a history of women dying. 52 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting a woman as an equal citizen[ ],with all the rights, privileges, and obligations that status entails. Gonzales, 550 U. S. ,at 172 (Gins burg, J. ,dissenting); see supra ,at 2324. It reflects that she is an autonomous person, and that society and the law recognize her as such. Like many constitutional rights, the right to choose situates a woman in relationship to other s and to the government. It helps define a sphere of freedom, in which a person has the capacity to make choices free of government control. As Ca sey recognized, the right order[s] her thinking as well as her living. 505 U. S. ,at 856. Beyond any individual choice about residence, or education, or career, her whole life reflects the control and authority that the right grants. Withdrawing a womans right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy does not mean that no choice is being made. It means that a majority of todays Court has wrenched this choice from women and given it to the States. To allow a State to exert control over one of the most intimate and personal choices a woman may make is not only to affect the course of her life, monumental as those effects might be. Id. ,at 851. It is to alter her views of [herself] and her understanding of her place[ ]in society as someone with the recognized dignity and authority to make these choices. Id. ,at 856. Women have relied on Roe and Ca sey in this way for 50 years. Many have never known anything else. When Roe and Ca sey disappear, the loss of power, control, and dignity will be immense. The Courts failure to perceive the whole swath of expectations Roe and Ca sey created reflects an impoverished view of reliance. According to the majority, a reliance interest must be very concrete, like those involving property or contract. Ante, at 64. While many of this Courts cases addressing reliance have been in the commercial context, Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 855, none holds that interests must be analogous to commercial ones to warrant stare de 53 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting c isis protection. 28 This unprecedented assertion is, at bottom, a radical claim to power. By disclaiming any need to consider broad swaths of individuals interests, the Court arrogates to itself the authority to overrule established legal principles without even ac knowledging the costs of its decisions for the individuals who live under the law, costs that this Courts stare dec isis doctrine instructs us to privilege when deciding whet her to change course. The majority claims that the reliance interests women have in Roe and Ca sey are too intangible for the Court to consider, even if it were inclined to do so. Ante ,at 65. This is to ignore as judges what we know as men and women. The interests women have in Roe and Ca sey are perfectly, viscerally concrete. Countless women will now make different decisions about careers, education, relationships, and whether to try to become pregnant than they would have when Roe served as a backstop. Other women will carry pregnancies to term, with all the costs and risk of harm that involves, when they would previously have chosen to obtain an abortion. For millions of women, Roe and Ca sey have been critical in giving them control of their bodies and their lives. Closing our eyes to the suffering todays decision will impose will not make that suffering disappear. The majority cannot escape its obligation to count[ ]the cost[s] of its decision by invoking the conflicting arguments of contending sides. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 855; ante, at 65. Stare dec isis requires that the Court calculate the costs of a decisions repudiation on those who have relied on the decision, 28The majoritys sole citation for its concreteness requirement is Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808 (1991). But Pay ne merely discounted reliance interests in cases involving procedural and evidentiary rules. Id. ,at 828. Unlike the individual right at stake here, those rules do not alter primary conduct. Ho hn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 252 (1998). Accordingly, they generally do not implicate the reliance interests of private parties at all. All eyne v. United States States, 570 U. S. 99, 119 (2013) (SOTOMAYOR ,J. ,concurring). 54 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting not on those who have disavowed it. See Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 855. More broadly, the majoritys approach to reliance cannot be reconciled with our Nations understanding of constitutional rights. The majoritys insistence on a concrete, economic showing would preclude a finding of reliance on a wide variety of decisions recognizing constitutional rights such as the right to express opinions, or choose whom to marry, or decide how to educate children. The Court, on the majoritys logic, could transfer those choices to the State without having to consider a persons settled understanding that the law makes them hers. That must be wrong. All those rights, like the right to obtain an abortion, profoundly affect and, indeed, anchor individual lives. To recognize that people have relied on these rights is not to dabble in abstractions, but to acknowledge some of the most concrete and familiar aspects of human life and liberty. Ante ,at 64. All those rights, like the one here, also have a societal dimension, because of the role constitutional liberties play in our structure of government. See, e. g. g., Dicker son , 530 U. S. ,at 443 (recognizing that Mir anda warnings have become part of our national culture in declining to overrule Mir anda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966)). Rescinding an individual right in its entirety and conferring it on the State, an action the Court takes today fo r the first time in history, affects all who have relied on our constitutional system of government and its structure of individual liberties protected from state oversight. Roe and Ca sey have of course aroused controversy and provoked disagreement. But the right those decisions conferred and reaffirmed is part of societys understanding of constitutional law and of how the Court has defined the liberty and equality that women are entitled to claim. After today, young women will come of age with fewer 55 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting rights than their mothers and grandmothers had. majority accomplishes that result without so much as considering how women have relied on the right to choose or what it means to take that right away. The majoritys refusal even to consider the life altering consequences of reversing Roe and Ca sey is a stunning indictment of its decision. D One last consideration counsels against the majoritys ruling: the very controversy surrounding Roe and Ca sey The majority accuses Ca sey of acting outside the bounds of the law to quell the conflict over abortion of imposing an unprincipled settlement of the issue in an effort to end national division. Ante ,at 67. But that is not what Ca sey did. As shown above, Ca sey applied traditional principles of stare decisiswhich the majority today ignore sin reaffirming Roe. Ca sey carefully assessed changed circumstances (none) and reliance interests (profound). It considered every aspect of how Roes framework operated. It adhered to the law in its analysis, and it reached the conclusion that the law required. True enough that Ca sey took notice of the national controversy about abortion: The Court knew in 1992, as it did in 1973, that abortion was a divisive issue. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 867868; see Roe, 410 U. S. ,at 116. But Ca sey s reason for acknowledging public conflict was the exact opposite of what the majority insinuates. Ca sey addressed the national controversy in order to emphasize how important it was, in that case of all cases, for the Court to stick to the law. Would that todays majority had done likewise. Consider how the majority it self summarizes this aspect of Ca sey :The American peoples belief in the rule of law would be shaken if they lost respect for this Court as an institution that decides important cases based on principle, not social and political pressures. There is a special 56 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting danger that the public will perceive a decision as having been made for unprincipled reasons when the Court overrules a controversial watershed decision, such as Roe. A decision overruling Roe would be perceived as having been made under fire and as a surrender to political pressure. Ante, at 6667 (citations omitted). That seems to us a good description. And it seems to us right. The majority responds (if we understand it correctly): well, yes, but we have to apply the law. See ante, at 67. To which Ca sey would have said: That is exactly the point. Here, more than anywhere, the Court needs to apply the law particularly the law of stare dec isis. Here, we know that citizens will continue to contest the Courts decision, because [m]en and women of good conscience deeply disa gree about abortion. Ca sey , 505 U. S. ,at 850. When that contestation takes place but when there is no legal basis for reversing course the Court needs to be steadfast, to stand its ground. That is what the rule of law requires. And that is what respect for this Court depends on. The promise of constancy, once given in so charged an environment, Ca sey explained, fundamentally as to render the commitment obsolete. Id. ,at 868. A breach of that promise is nothing less than a breach of faith. Ibid. [A]nd no Court that broke its faith with the people could sensibly expect credit for principle. Ibid. No Court breaking its faith in that way would deserve credit for principle. As one of Ca sey s authors wrote in another case, Our legitimacy requires, above all, that we adhere to stare dec isis in sensitive political contexts where partisan controversy abounds. Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 985 (1996) (opinion of OConnor, J. ).Justice Jackson once called a decision he dissented from a loaded weapon, ready to hand for improper uses. Kore matsu v. United States States, 323 U. S. 214, 246 (1944). We fear 57 Cite as: 597 U. S. (2022) BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting that todays decision, departing from stare dec isis for no legitimate reason, is its own loaded weapon. Weakening stare dec isis threatens to upend bedrock legal doctrines, far beyond any single decision. Weakening stare dec isis creates profound legal instability. And as Ca sey recognized, weakening stare dec isis in a hotly contested case like this one calls into question this Court s commitment to legal principle. It makes the Court appear not restrained but aggressive, not modest but grasping. In all those ways, todays decision takes aim, we fear, at the rule of law. III Power, not reason, is the new currency of this Courts decision making. Pay ne , 501 U. S. ,at 844 (Marshall, J. ,dissenting). Roe has stood for fifty years. Ca sey ,a precedent about precedent specifically confirming Roe, has stood for thirty. And the doctrine of stare dec isis a critical element of the rule of law stands foursquare behind their continued existence. The right those decisions established and preserved is embedded in our constitutional law, both originating in and leading to other rights protecting bodily integrity, personal autonomy, and family relationships. The abortion right is also embedded in the lives of women shaping their expectations, influencing their choices about relationships and work, supporting (as all reproductive rights do) their social and economic equality. Since the rights recognition (and affirmation), nothing has changed to support what the majority does today. Neither law nor facts nor attitudes have provided any new reasons to rea cha different result than Roe and Ca sey did. All that has changed is this Court. Mississippi and other States too knew exactly what they were doing in ginning up new legal challenges to Roe and Ca sey The 15-week ban at issue here was enacted in 2018. Other States quickly followed: Between 2019 and 2021, eight States banned abortion procedures after six to 58 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting eight weeks of pregnancy, and three States enacted al lout bans. 29 Mississippi itself decided in 2019 that it had not gone far enough: The year after enacting the law under review, the State passed a 6-week restriction. A state senator who championed both Mississippi laws said the obvious out loud. [A] lot of people thought, he explained, that finally, we have a conservative Court and so now would be a good time to start testing the limits of Roe. 30 In its petition for certiorari, the State had exercised a smidgen of restraint. It had urged the Court merely to roll back Roe and Ca sey ,specifically assuring the Court that the questions presented in this petition do (ROBERTS ,C. J. ,concurring in judgment). But as Mississippi grew ever more confident in its prospects, it resolved to go all in. It urge d the Court to overrule Roe and Ca sey Nothing but everything would be enough. Earlier this Term, this Court signaled that Mississippis stratagem would succeed. Texas was one of the fistful of States to have recently banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. It added to that flagrantly unconstitutional restriction an unprecedented scheme to evade judicial 29Guttmacher Institute, E.

They let Texas defy this Courts constitutional rulings, nullifying Roe and Ca sey ahead of schedule in the Nations second largest State. And now the other shoe drops, courtesy of that same five person majority. (We believe that T HE CHIEF JUSTICE s opinion is wrong too, but no one should think that there i snot a large difference between upholding a 15-week ban on the grounds he does and allowing States to abortion from the time of conception. )Now a new and bare majority of this Court acting at practically the first moment possible overrules Roe and Ca sey It converts a series of dissenting opinions expressing antipathy toward Roe and Ca sey into a decision green lighting even total abortion bans. See ante, at 57, 59, 63, and n n. 6164 (relying on former dissents). It eliminates a 50-year-old constitutional right that safeguards womens freedom and equal station. It breaches a core ruleoflaw principle, designed to promote constancy in the law. In doing all of that, it places in contraception to same sex intimacy and marriage. And finally, it undermines the Courts legitimacy. Ca sey itself made the last point in explaining why it would not overrule Roe though some members of its majority might not have joined Roe in the first instance. Just as we did here, Ca sey explained the importance of stare de c isis; the inappositeness of West Coast Hotel and Brown ;the absence of any changed circumstances (or other reason) justifying the reversal of precedent. 505 U. S. ,at 864; see supra, at 3033, 3747. [T]he Court, Ca sey explained, could not pretend that overruling Roe had any justification beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come out differently from the Court of 1973. 505 U. S. ,at 864. And to overrule for that reason? Quoting Justice Stewart, Ca sey 60 DO BBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BR EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. ,dissenting explained that to do s oto re verse prior law upon a ground no firmer than a change in [the Courts] membership would invite the view that this institution is little different from the two political branches of the Government. Ibid. No view, Ca sey thought, could do more lasting injury to this Court and to the system of law which it is our abiding mission to serve. Ibid. For overruling Roe, Ca sey concluded, the Court would pay a terrible price. 505 U. S. ,at 864. The Justices who wrote those wordsOConnor, Kennedy, and Souter they were judges of wisdom. They would not have won any contests for the kind of ideological purity some court watchers want Justices to deliver. But if there were awards for Justices who left this Court better than they found it? And who for that reason stronger? Sign those Justices up. They knew that the legitimacy of the Court [is] earned over time. Id. ,at 868. They also would have recognized that it can be destroyed much more quickly. They worked hard to avert that outcome in Ca sey The American public, they thought, should never conclude that its constitutional protections hung by a thread that a new majority, adhering to a new doctrinal school, could by dint of numbers alone expunge their rights. Id. ,at 864. It is hard no, it is impossible to conclude that anything else has happened here. One of us once said that [i]t is not often in the law that so few have so quickly c hanged so much. S. Br eyer, Breaking the Promise of Brown :The Re segregation of Americas Schools 30 (2022). For all of us, in our time on this Court, that has never been more true than today. In overruling Roe and Ca sey ,this Court betrays its guiding principles. With sorrow for this Court, but more, for the many mil lions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection we dissent.

Additional cases the majority cites involved fundamental factual changes that had undermined the basic premise of the prior precedent. See Citizens United v. Federal Election Commn , 558 U.

Some cited overrulings involved both significant doctrinal developments and changed facts or understandings that had together undermined a basic premise of the prior decision. See Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees, 585 U. S. S.,, (2018) (slip o p. ,at 42, 4749) (holding that requiring public sector union dues from nonmembers violates the First Amendment, and overruling A bood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U.

Florida, 368 U. S. 57 (1961), had been rendered inconsistent with equal protection jurisprudence). Other overrulings occurred very close in time to the original decision so did not engender substantial reliance and could not be described as having been embedded as part of our national culture. Dicker son v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000); see Pay ne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808 (1991) (revising procedural ru les of evidence that had barred admission of certain victim impact evidence during the penalty phase of capital cases, and overruling South Carolina v.

JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Appendix to opinion of B R EYER , SOTOMAYOR ,and K A GAN , J J. to protect). The rest of the cited cases were relatively minor in their effect, modifying part or an application of a prior precedents test or analysis. See Monte jo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778 (2009) (citing workability and practical concerns with additional layers of prophylactic procedural safeguards for defendants right to counsel, as had been enshrined in Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625 (1986)); Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, Texas, 378 U. S. 108 (1964), and Spin elli v. United States, 393 U.

R. 8916 Introduced in House (I H)] 117th CONGRESS 2d Session H. R. 8916 To establish leave policies of the Armed Forces for a member to seek an abortion. IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES September 20, 2022 Mr. Crow (for himself, Ms. Speier, Mr. Brown of Maryland, Ms. Nor ton, Ms. Strickland, Ms. Dean, Ms. Porter, Ms. L ois Frank el of Florida, Mr. Moul ton, Mr. Mc Govern, Mrs. Tor res of California, Ms. Lee of California, Mr. Evans, Mr. Grijalva, Ms. Brown ley, and Ms. Sher rill) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services A BILL To establish leave policies of the Armed Forces for a member to seek an abortion. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the Access to Reproductive Care for Service members Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Following the Supreme Court's decision to eliminate the right to abortion, States across the country are moving swiftly to ban abortion access, leading to even greater barriers to care for military families. (2) Access to abortion care is essential to a person's health and central to their economic and social wellbeing. Bans and restrictions on abortion delay access to abortion care and therefore increase costs for members of the Armed Forces seeking care. The consequence of these delays and barriers could mean that a person is forced to carry a pregnancy against their will. (3) The Armed Forces have a large presence in many States poised to ban or restrict access to abortion, many of which also neighbor States that would likely ban abortion. (4) Members of the Armed Forces seeking care off base may be limited in their ability to do so due to restrictions on leave or travel restrictions imposed by their unit. (5) Restrictions on receiving approval to take leave for abortion care interfere with a member of the Armed Forces' health, wellbeing, and right to access the care they need. The decision to terminate a pregnancy should not depend on the discretion or judgment of a military commander. (6) The Army has recognized that abortion is a time sensitive procedure and access should not be delayed for members or military families. (7) When a member of the Armed Forces decides to obtain an abortion, it should be available, affordable, private, and free from punishment, reprisal, or judgment by the member's chain of command. (8) The harms of abortion specific restrictions fall most heavily on people who already face barriers to accessing health care including people with low incomes, such as junior members, and Black, Indigenous, and people of color, immigrants, young people, people with disabilities, the LGBTQI community, and those stationed in rural and other medically under served areas. (9) Equal access to abortion care, everywhere, is essential to social and economic participation, equality, reproductive autonomy, and the right to determine a person's own life. (10) The denial of leave for an abortion or any other reproductive health service violates the rights of members of the Armed Forces. Access to care for military families should not be determined by the personal beliefs of other s. (11) In addition to the health and wellbeing implications for members of the Armed Forces and their families, the failure to address these issues will contribute to the challenges that the Armed Forces faces in attracting and retaining personnel, thereby negatively affecting military strength and readiness. SEC. 3. LEAVE FOR A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES FOR ABORTION. (a) In General. The Secretary concerned (as such term is defined in section 101 of title 10, United States Code) shall, with regards to abortion care for a member of the Armed Forces (1) consider such care to be time sensitive and therefore approve leave for such abortion care; and (2) not require the member to disclose to a commanding officer the time sensitive care or procedure being received during such leave. (b) Reimbursement for Travel. In a jurisdiction where abortion is prohibited or inaccessible, the Secretary concerned shall reimburse the member for costs incurred by the member to travel to a different jurisdiction for an abortion. (c) Privacy. Health care providers of the Defense Health Agency and commanding officers shall, to the greatest extent practicable, protect the privacy of a member who takes leave under this section, including when such member makes a request for such leave and when such member returns to duty. (d) Prohibition. No member of the Armed Forces may be subject to any adverse action for requesting or taking leave under this section.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_text_ner\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_text_ner_agg\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_text_laws_agg\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
