        "# Week 8 - Conversation and Text Generation\n",
        "Many natural language activities boil down to text generation, especially the back-and-forth nature of natural conversation and question answering. While some may regard it as a parlour trick due to unpredictability, recent dramatic improvements in text generation suggest that these kind of models can find themselves being used in more serious social scientific applications, as in survey design and construction, idiomatic translation, and the normalization of phrase and sentence meanings.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Much recent NLP research is on text generation. Before the phenomenal product ChatGPT (OpenAI) was released at the end of 2022,  this is the primary use of large language models like GPT-3/4 (OpenAI), Wu Dao (Beijing Academy of AI), and Gopher (DeepMind). Then everything went wild in 2023. We saw tons of open-sourced LLMs were released like the Llama series (Meta), and how others techs wanted to compete with OpenAI by releasing models like Claude (Anthropic), Bard (Google), Gemini (Google x2), etc. The success of these models have prompted debate over whether the risks and perils of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is approaching!"

R. 8916 Introduced in House (I H)] 117th CONGRESS 2d Session H. R. 8916 To establish leave policies of the Armed Forces for a member to seek an abortion. IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES September 20, 2022 Mr. Crow (for himself, Ms. Speier, Mr. Brown of Maryland, Ms. Nor ton, Ms. Strickland, Ms. Dean, Ms. Porter, Ms. L ois Frank el of Florida, Mr. Moul ton, Mr. Mc Govern, Mrs. Tor res of California, Ms. Lee of California, Mr. Evans, Mr. Grijalva, Ms. Brown ley, and Ms. Sher rill) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services A BILL To establish leave policies of the Armed Forces for a member to seek an abortion. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the Access to Reproductive Care for Service members Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Following the Supreme Court's decision to eliminate the right to abortion, States across the country are moving swiftly to ban abortion access, leading to even greater barriers to care for military families. (2) Access to abortion care is essential to a person's health and central to their economic and social wellbeing. Bans and restrictions on abortion delay access to abortion care and therefore increase costs for members of the Armed Forces seeking care. The consequence of these delays and barriers could mean that a person is forced to carry a pregnancy against their will. (3) The Armed Forces have a large presence in many States poised to ban or restrict access to abortion, many of which also neighbor States that would likely ban abortion. (4) Members of the Armed Forces seeking care off base may be limited in their ability to do so due to restrictions on leave or travel restrictions imposed by their unit. (5) Restrictions on receiving approval to take leave for abortion care interfere with a member of the Armed Forces' health, wellbeing, and right to access the care they need. The decision to terminate a pregnancy should not depend on the discretion or judgment of a military commander. (6) The Army has recognized that abortion is a time sensitive procedure and access should not be delayed for members or military families. (7) When a member of the Armed Forces decides to obtain an abortion, it should be available, affordable, private, and free from punishment, reprisal, or judgment by the member's chain of command. (8) The harms of abortion specific restrictions fall most heavily on people who already face barriers to accessing health care including people with low incomes, such as junior members, and Black, Indigenous, and people of color, immigrants, young people, people with disabilities, the LGBTQI community, and those stationed in rural and other medically under served areas. (9) Equal access to abortion care, everywhere, is essential to social and economic participation, equality, reproductive autonomy, and the right to determine a person's own life. (10) The denial of leave for an abortion or any other reproductive health service violates the rights of members of the Armed Forces. Access to care for military families should not be determined by the personal beliefs of other s. (11) In addition to the health and wellbeing implications for members of the Armed Forces and their families, the failure to address these issues will contribute to the challenges that the Armed Forces faces in attracting and retaining personnel, thereby negatively affecting military strength and readiness. SEC. 3. LEAVE FOR A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES FOR ABORTION. (a) In General. The Secretary concerned (as such term is defined in section 101 of title 10, United States Code) shall, with regards to abortion care for a member of the Armed Forces (1) consider such care to be time sensitive and therefore approve leave for such abortion care; and (2) not require the member to disclose to a commanding officer the time sensitive care or procedure being received during such leave. (b) Reimbursement for Travel. In a jurisdiction where abortion is prohibited or inaccessible, the Secretary concerned shall reimburse the member for costs incurred by the member to travel to a different jurisdiction for an abortion. (c) Privacy. Health care providers of the Defense Health Agency and commanding officers shall, to the greatest extent practicable, protect the privacy of a member who takes leave under this section, including when such member makes a request for such leave and when such member returns to duty. (d) Prohibition. No member of the Armed Forces may be subject to any adverse action for requesting or taking leave under this section.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_text_ner\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_text_ner_agg\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_text_laws_agg\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
