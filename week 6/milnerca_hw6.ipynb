        "# Programming LLMs with Language\n",
        "\n",
        "In previous chapters, we saw how we can use the semantic information in large language models (LLMs) through standard nlp pipelines (e.g., classification) or using their underlying embeddings. But LLMs are *natively* programmed through language. Moreover, recent scholarship has both [**argued**](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.247/) and then [**demonstrated**](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/von-oswald23a.html) how LLMs perform gradient descent on their internal, high-dimensional representations to optimize a response to a language prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook accompanying the chapter on programming LLMs with language, we will explore various ways we can interact with some of the most powerful deep learning models today using language."

See United States  v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co.,  200 U. S. 321, 337. \\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \\nSyllabus \\nDOBBS, STATE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE \\nMISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, ET AL . v. \\nJACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION ET AL . \\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \\nTHE FIFTH CIRCUIT \\nNo. 19–1392. Argued December 1, 2021—Decided June 24, 2022 \\nMississippi’s Gestational Age Act prov ides that “[e]xcept in a medical\\nemergency or in the case of a seve re fetal abnormality, a person shall\\nnot intentionally or knowingly perform . . . or induce an abortion of an \\nunborn human being if the probable gestational age of the unborn hu -\\nman being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15) weeks.” \\nMiss. Code Ann. §41–41–191.  Respondents—Jackson Women’s Health \\nOrganization, an abortion clinic, and one of its doctors—challenged the\\nAct in Federal District Court, alleging that it violated this Court’s prec -\\nedents establishing a constitutional  right to abortion, in particular Roe \\nv. Wade , 410 U. S. 113, and Planned Parenthood of  Southeastern Pa. \\nv. Casey , 505 U. S. 833.  The District Court granted summary judg -\\nment in favor of respondents and permanently enjoined enforcement of the Act, reasoning that Mississippi’s 15-week restriction on abortion \\nviolates this Court’s cases forbidding  States to ban abortion pre-viabil-\\nity.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  Be fore this Court, petitioners defend \\nthe Act on the grounds that Roe and Casey  were wrongly decided and\\nthat the Act is constitutional becaus e it satisfies rational-basis review. \\nHeld : The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey\\nare overruled; and the au thority to regulate abortion is returned to the \\npeople and their elected representatives.  Pp. 8–79.\\n(a) The critical question is wh ether the Constitution, properly un-\\nderstood, confers a right to  obtain an abortion. Casey ’s controlling\\nopinion skipped over that question and reaffirmed Roe  solely on the\\nbasis of stare decisis . A proper application of stare decisis , however, \\nrequires an assessment of the st rength of the grounds on which Roe \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 2 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nSyllabus \\nwas based. The Court therefore turns to the question that the Casey\\nplurality did not consider.  Pp. 8–32.\\n(1) First, the Court reviews th e standard that the Court’s cases \\nhave used to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment’s refer-\\nence to “liberty” protects a particul ar right.  The Constitution makes \\nno express reference to a right to obtain an abortion, but several con-\\nstitutional provisions have been o ffered as potential homes for an im-\\nplicit constitutional right. Roe held that the abortion right is part of a\\nright to privacy that springs from the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and\\nFourteenth Amendments.  See 410 U. S., at 152–153.  The Casey  Court \\ngrounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an\\nabortion is part of the “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amend-\\nment’s Due Process Clause. Others have suggested that support can be found in the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, but \\nthat theory is squarely foreclosed by the Court’s prec edents, which es-\\ntablish that a State’s regulation of abortion is not a sex-based classifi-\\ncation and is thus not subject to th e heightened scrutiny that applies \\nto such classifications.  See Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U. S. 484, 496, \\nn. 20; Bray  v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic , 506 U. S. 263, 273– \\n274. Rather, regulations and prohibitions of abortion are governed by\\nthe same standard of review as ot her health and safety measures. \\nPp. 9–11.\\n(2) Next, the Court examines wh ether the right to obtain an abor -\\ntion is rooted in the Nation’s history and tradition and whether it is anessential component of “ordered lib erty.”  The Court finds that the \\nright to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and tradi-\\ntion.  The underlying theory on which Casey  rested—that the Four-\\nteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause provides  substantive, as well \\nas procedural, protection for “liberty ”—has long been controversial.  \\nThe Court’s decisions have held that the Due Process Clause pro-\\ntects two categories of substantive rights—those rights guaranteed by\\nthe first eight Amendments to th e Constitution and those rights\\ndeemed fundamental that are not me ntioned anywhere in the Consti-\\ntution. In deciding whether a right fa lls into either of these categories,\\nthe question is whether the right is “deeply rooted in [our] history and\\ntradition” and whether it is essentia l to this Nation’s “scheme of or -\\ndered liberty.” Timbs  v. Indiana , 586 U. S. ___, ___ (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted).  The term “liberty ” alone provides little guidance. \\nThus, historical inquiries are essent ial whenever the Court is asked to\\nrecognize a new component of the “ liberty” interest protected by the \\nDue Process Clause. In interpreting what is meant by “liberty,” the Court must guard against the natu ral human tendency to confuse \\nwhat the Fourteenth Am endment protects with the Court’s own ardent\\nviews about the liberty that American s should enjoy.  For this reason, \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   3 Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) \\nSyllabus \\nthe Court has been “reluctant” to recognize rights that are not men-\\ntioned in the Constitution.  Collins v. Harker Heights , 503 U. S. 115, 125. \\nGuided by the history and tradition that map the essential compo-\\nnents of the Nation’s concept of ordered liberty, the Court finds the \\nFourteenth Amendment clearly does not protect the right to an abor -\\ntion. Until the latter part of the 20t h century, there was no support in \\nAmerican law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion.  No state constitutional provision had recognized  such a right.  Until a few years \\nbefore Roe, no federal or state court had recognized such a right.  Nor \\nhad any scholarly treatise.  Indeed, abortion had long been a crime in \\nevery single State. At common la w, abortion was criminal in at least \\nsome stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could \\nhave very serious consequences at all stages.  American law followed \\nthe common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s ex -\\npanded criminal liability for abortions.  By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three-quarters of the States had made abor -\\ntion a crime at any stage of pregna ncy.  This consensus endured until \\nthe day Roe was decided. Roe either ignored or mi sstated this history, \\nand Casey  declined to reconsider Roe’s faulty historical analysis.\\nRespondents’ argument that this history does not matter flies in the \\nface of the standard the Court has applied in determining whether an \\nasserted right that is nowhere ment ioned in the Constitution is never -\\ntheless protected by th e Fourteenth Amendment.  The Solicitor Gen-\\neral repeats Roe’s claim that it is “doubtful . . . abortion was ever firmly \\nestablished as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruc -\\ntion of a quick fetus,” 410 U. S., at 136, but the great common-law au -\\nthorities—Bracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstone—all wrote that a post-\\nquickening abortion was a crime.  Moreover, many authorities as-serted that even a pre-quickening abortion was “unlawful” and that,\\nas a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from \\nthe attempt.  The Solicitor General suggests that history supports an\\nabortion right because of the common law’s failure to criminalize abor-\\ntion before quickening, but the insistence on quickening was not uni-\\nversal, see Mills  v. Commonwealth , 13 Pa. 631, 633; State v. Slagle , 83 \\nN. C. 630, 632, and regardless, the fact that many States in the late \\n18th and early 19th century did no t criminalize pre-quickening abor-\\ntions does not mean that anyone th ought the States lacked the author-\\nity to do so. \\nInstead of seriously pressing th e argument that the abortion right \\nitself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Casey  contend that the \\nabortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right. Roe \\ntermed this a right to privacy, 410 U. S., at 154, and Casey described \\nit as the freedom to make “intimat e and personal choices” that are \\n“central to personal dignity and autonomy,” 505 U. S., at 851.  Ordered \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n  4 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nSyllabus \\nliberty sets limits and defines th e boundary between competing inter-\\nests. Roe and Casey  each struck a particular balance between the in -\\nterests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interests of what \\nthey termed “potential life.”  Roe , 410 U. S., at 150; Casey , 505 U. S., \\nat 852. But the people of the vari ous States may evaluate those inter-\\nests differently.  The Nation’s historical understanding of ordered lib-erty does not prevent the people’s elected representatives from decid-\\ning how abortion should be regulated.  Pp. 11–30.\\n(3) Finally, the Court considers whether a right to obtain an abor -\\ntion is part of a broader entrenched  right that is supported by other \\nprecedents. The Court concludes the right to obtain an abortion cannot \\nbe justified as a component of such a right.  Attempts to justify abor -\\ntion through appeals to a broader righ t to autonomy and to define one’s \\n“concept of existence” prove too much.  Casey , 505 U. S., at 851.  Those \\ncriteria, at a high level of generalit y, could license fundamental rights \\nto illicit drug use, pros titution, and the like. What sharply distin-\\nguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on \\nwhich Roe and Casey  rely is something that  both those decisions \\nacknowledged: Abortion is differe nt because it destroys what Roe \\ntermed “potential life” and what the law challenged in this case calls \\nan “unborn human being.”  None of the other decisions cited by Roe \\nand Casey  involved the critical moral qu estion posed by abortion.  Ac -\\ncordingly, those cases do not support  the right to obtain an abortion, \\nand the Court’s conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such \\na right does not undermine them in any way.  Pp. 30–32.\\n(b) The doctrine of stare decisis does not counsel continued ac -\\nceptance of Roe and Casey . Stare decisis  plays an important role and \\nprotects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a \\npast decision.  It “reduces incent ives for challenging settled prece-\\ndents, saving parties and courts th e expense of endless relitigation.” \\nKimble  v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC , 576 U. S. 446, 455.  It “contrib-\\nutes to the actual and perceived in tegrity of the judicial process.” \\nPayne v. Tennessee , 501 U. S. 808, 827.  And it restrains judicial hubris \\nby respecting the judgment of th ose who grappled with important \\nquestions in the past.  But stare decisis  is not an inexorable command, \\nPearson  v. Callahan , 555 U. S. 223, 233, and “is at its weakest when \\n[the Court] interpret[s] the Constitution,” Agostini v. Felton , 521 U. S. \\n203, 235.  Some of the Court’s most important constitutional decisions\\nhave overruled prior precedents.  See, e.g., Brown  v. Board of Educa-\\ntion, 347 U. S. 483, 491 (overruling the infamous decision in Plessy  v. \\nFerguson , 163 U. S. 537, and its progeny).  \\nThe Court’s cases have identified factors that should be considered \\nin deciding when a preceden t should be overruled. Janus v. State, \\nCounty, and Municipal Employees , 585 U. S. ___, ___–___. Five factors \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  5 Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) \\nSyllabus \\ndiscussed below weigh strong ly in favor of overruling Roe and Casey . \\nPp. 39–66. \\n(1) The nature of the Court’s error .  Like the infamous decision in \\nPlessy v. Ferguson , Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision \\ncourse with the Constitution from the day it was decided. Casey per-\\npetuated its errors, calling both sides of the national controversy to \\nresolve their debate,  but in doing so, Casey necessarily declared a win-\\nning side. Those on the losing side—those who sought to advance the State’s interest in fetal life—could no longer seek to persuade theirelected representatives to adopt polic ies consistent with their views. \\nThe Court short-circuited the democra tic process by closing it to the \\nlarge number of Americans who disagreed with Roe. Pp. 43–45. \\n(2) The quality of the reasoning . Without any grounding in the \\nconstitutional text, hi story, or precedent, Roe  imposed on the entire \\ncountry a detailed set of rules for pregnancy divided into trimesters \\nmuch like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation. \\nSee 410 U. S., at 163–164.  Roe’s failure even to note the overwhelming \\nconsensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said\\nabout the common law was simply wr ong.  Then, after surveying his -\\ntory, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee, and did not explain why the source s on which it relied sh ed light on the mean -\\ning of the Constitution. As to preced ent, citing a broad array of cases,\\nthe Court found support for a constituti onal “right of personal privacy.” \\nId., at 152. But Roe conflated the right to shield information from dis-\\nclosure and the right to make and implement important personal de-\\ncisions without governmental interference. See Whalen  v. Roe, 429 \\nU. S. 589, 599–600.  None of these decisions involved what is distinc -\\ntive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed “potential life.” \\nWhen the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on\\nthe country, it asserted that its rules were “consistent with,” among\\nother things, “the relative weights of  the respective interests involved”\\nand “the demands of the profound problems of the present day.”  Roe, \\n410 U. S. , at 165.  These are precisely the sort of considerations that \\nlegislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that \\naccommodate competing in terests.  The scheme Roe  produced looked \\nlike legislation, and the Court provid ed the sort of explanation that \\nmight be expected from a legislative body.  An even more glaring defi-\\nciency was Roe’s failure to justify the critical distinction it drew be-\\ntween pre- and post-viability abortions.  See id., at 163. The arbitrary \\nviability line, which Casey  termed Roe ’s central rule, has not found \\nmuch support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted \\nto justify a right to abortion.  The most obvious problem with any such \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n   6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nSyllabus \\nargument is that viability has changed over time and is heavily de-\\npendent on factors—such as medica l advances and the availability of\\nquality medical care—that have nothin g to do with the characteristics\\nof a fetus. \\nWhen Casey revisited Roe almost 20 years later, it reaffirmed Roe’s \\ncentral holding , but pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its rea-\\nsoning.  The Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and in -\\nstead grounded the abortion right en tirely on the Fourteenth Amend-\\nment’s Due Process Clause. 505 U. S ., at 846.  The controlling opinion \\ncriticized and rejected Roe ’s trimester scheme, 505 U. S., at 872, and \\nsubstituted a new and obscure “undue burden” test.  Casey , in short, \\neither refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roe’s analy -\\nsis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roe’s reasoning, endorsed\\nwhat it termed Roe ’s central holding while suggesting that a majority\\nmight not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the abortion right other than Roe’s status as precedent, and imposed a new \\ntest with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or prece-dent.  Pp. 45–56.\\n(3) Workability .  Deciding whether a precedent should be over-\\nruled depends in part on whether the rule it imposes is workable—thatis, whether it can be understood an d applied in a consistent and pre-\\ndictable manner. Casey ’s “undue burden” test ha s scored poorly on the \\nworkability scale.  The Casey  plurality tried to put meaning into the \\n“undue burden” test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these \\nrules created their own problems.  And the difficulty of applying Ca-\\nsey’s new rules surfaced in that very case.  Compare 505 U. S., at 881– \\n887, with id., at 920–922 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissent-\\ning in part). The experience of th e Courts of Appeals provides further \\nevidence that Casey ’s “line between” permissi ble and unconstitutional \\nrestrictions “has proved to be im possible to draw with precision.”  Ja-\\nnus, 585 U. S., at ___. Casey has generated a long list of Circuit con-\\nflicts.  Continued adherence to Casey ’s unworkable “undue burden” \\ntest would undermine, not advance, the “evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles.” Payne , 501 U. S., at 827. \\nPp. 56–62. \\n(4) Effect on other areas of law . Roe and Casey have led to the \\ndistortion of many important but un related legal doctrines, and that \\neffect provides further support for overruling those decisions. See Ra-\\nmos v. Louisiana , 590 U. S. ___, ___ (K\\nAVANAUGH , J., concurring in \\npart).  Pp. 62–63.\\n(5) Reliance interests. Overruling Roe and Casey  will not upend \\nconcrete reliance interests like those that develop in “cases involving \\nproperty and contract rights.” Payne , 501 U. S., at 828.  In Casey , the \\ncontrolling opinion conceded that traditional reliance interests were \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 7 Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) \\nSyllabus \\nnot implicated because getting an abortion is generally “unplanned ac -\\ntivity,” and “reproductive planning could take virtually immediate ac -\\ncount of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions.” \\n505 U. S., at 856.  Instead, the opinion perceived a more intangible form of reliance, namely, that “people [had] organized intimate rela -\\ntionships and made choices that define their views of themselves andtheir places in society . . . in relianc e on the availability of abortion in \\nthe event that contraception should  fail” and that “[t]he ability of\\nwomen to participate equally in the ec onomic and social life of the Na-\\ntion has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductivelives.” Ibid. The contending sides in this case make impassioned and \\nconflicting arguments about the effe cts of the abortion right on the \\nlives of women as well as the status of the fetus.  The Casey plurality’s\\nspeculative attempt to weigh the relative importance of the interests \\nof the fetus and the mother repres ent a departure from the “original \\nconstitutional proposition” that “cou rts do not substitute their social \\nand economic beliefs for the judg ment of legislative bodies.”  Ferguson \\nv. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 729–730. \\nThe Solicitor General suggests that overruling Roe and Casey  would \\nthreaten the protection of other ri ghts under the Due Process Clause.\\nThe Court emphasizes that this deci sion concerns the constitutional \\nright to abortion and no other right.  Nothing in this opinion should be\\nunderstood to cast doubt on preceden ts that do not concern abortion.\\nPp. 63–66. \\n(c) Casey identified another concern, namely, the danger that the \\npublic will perceive a decision over ruling a controversial “watershed”\\ndecision, such as Roe, as influenced by political considerations or pub-\\nlic opinion.  505 U. S., at 866–867.  But the Court cannot allow its de-cisions to be affected by such extr aneous concerns.  A precedent of this \\nCourt is subject to th e usual principles of stare decisis under which \\nadherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command.  If the rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy would still be \\nthe law. The Court’s job is to interpret the law, apply longstanding\\nprinciples of stare decisis , and decide this case accordingly.  Pp. 66–69.\\n(d)Under the Court’s precedents, rational-basis review is the appro-\\npriate standard to apply when state abortion regulations undergo con -\\nstitutional challenge.  Given that procuring an abortion is not a funda -\\nmental constitutional right, it follows that the States may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are chal -\\nlenged under the Constitution, courts cannot “substitute their social \\nand economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.”  Ferguson , \\n372 U. S., at 729–730.  That applies even when the laws at issue con -\\ncern matters of great social significance and moral substance.  A law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is entitled to a \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n 8 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION \\nSyllabus \\n“strong presumption of validity.” Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319.  It \\nmust be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature \\ncould have thought that it would se rve legitimate state interests.  Id., \\nat 320. \\nMississippi’s Gestational Age Act is supported by the Mississippi\\nLegislature’s specific findings, whic h include the State’s asserted in-\\nterest in “protecting the life of the unborn.”  §2(b)(i).  These legitimate\\ninterests provide a rational basis fo r the Gestational Age Act, and it\\nfollows that respondents’ constitutional challenge must fail.  Pp. 76– \\n78. \\n(e)Abortion presents a profound  moral question.  The Constitution \\ndoes not prohibit the citizens of ea ch State from regulating or prohib-\\niting abortion.

            "Miss. Code Ann. §41–41–191. Respondents—Jackson Women’s Health Organization, an abortion clinic, and one of its doctors—challenged the Act in Federal District Court, alleging that it violated this Court’s precedents establishing a constitutional right to abortion, in particular Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents and permanently enjoined enforcement of the Act, reasoning that Mississippi’s 15-week restriction on abortion violates this Court’s cases forbidding States to ban abortion pre-viability. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. Before this Court, petitioners defend the Act on the grounds that Roe and Casey were wrongly decided and that the Act is constitutional because it satisfies rational-basis review.\n",
            "Held: The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives. Pp. 8–79.\n",
            "(a) The critical question is whether the Constitution, properly understood, confers a right to obtain an abortion. Casey’s controlling opinion skipped over that question and reaffirmed Roe solely on the basis of stare decisis. A proper application of stare decisis, however, requires an assessment of the strength of the grounds on which Roe was based. The Court therefore turns to the question that the Casey plurality did not consider. Pp. 8–32.\n",
            "(1) First, the Court reviews the standard that the Court’s cases have used to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment’s reference to “liberty” protects a particular right. The Constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion, but several constitutional provisions have been offered as potential homes for an implicit constitutional right. Roe held that the abortion right is part of a right to privacy that springs from the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. See 410 U. S., at 152–153. The Casey Court grounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an abortion is part of the “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. Others have suggested that support can be found in the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, but that theory is squarely foreclosed by the Court’s precedents, which establish that a State’s regulation of abortion is not a sex-based classification and is thus not subject to the heightened scrutiny that applies to such classifications. See Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U. S. 484, 496, n. 20; Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U. S. 263, 273-274. Rather, regulations and prohibitions of abortion are governed by the same standard of review as other health and safety measures. Pp. 9–11.\n",
            "(2) Next, the Court examines whether the right to obtain an abortion is rooted in the Nation’s history and tradition and whether it is an essential component of “ordered liberty.” The Court finds that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and tradition. The underlying theory on which Casey rested—that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for “liberty”—has long been controversial. The Court’s decisions have held that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of substantive rights—those rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments to the Constitution and those rights deemed fundamental that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the question is whether the right is “deeply rooted in [our] history and tradition” and whether it is essential to this Nation’s “scheme of ordered liberty.” Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (internal quotation marks omitted). The term “liberty” alone provides little guidance. Thus, historical inquiries are essential whenever the Court is asked to recognize a new component of the “liberty” interest protected by the Due Process Clause. In interpreting what is meant by “liberty,” the Court must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse what the Fourteenth Amendment protects with the Court’s own ardent views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. For this reason, the Court has been “reluctant” to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution. Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125. Guided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of the Nation’s concept of ordered liberty, the Court finds the Fourteenth Amendment clearly does not protect the right to an abortion. Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years before Roe, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor had any scholarly treatise. Indeed, abortion had long been a crime in every single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy. This consensus endured until the day Roe was decided. Roe either ignored or misstated this history, and Casey declined to reconsider Roe’s faulty historical analysis. Respondents’ argument that this history does not matter flies in the face of the standard the Court has applied in determining whether an asserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is nevertheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Solicitor General repeats Roe’s claim that it is “doubtful . . . abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the\n",

            "Syllabus\n",
            "discussed below weigh strongly in favor of overruling Roe and Casey. Pp. 39–66. (1) The nature of the Court’s error. Like the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided. Casey perpetuated its errors, calling both sides of the national controversy to resolve their debate, but in doing so, Casey necessarily declared a winning side. Those on the losing side—those who sought to advance the State’s interest in fetal life—could no longer seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views. The Court short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who disagreed with Roe. Pp. 43–45. (2) The quality of the reasoning. Without any grounding in the constitutional text, history, or precedent, Roe imposed on the entire country a detailed set of rules for pregnancy divided into trimesters much like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation. See 410 U. S., at 163–164. Roe’s failure even to note the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said about the common law was simply wrong. Then, after surveying history, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee, and did not explain why the sources on which it relied shed light on the meaning of the Constitution. As to precedent, citing a broad array of cases, the Court found support for a constitutional “right of personal privacy.” Id., at 152. But Roe conflated the right to shield information from disclosure and the right to make and implement important personal decisions without governmental interference. See Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599–600. None of these decisions involved what is distinctive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed “potential life.” When the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on the country, it asserted that its rules were “consistent with,” among other things, “the relative weights of the respective interests involved” and “the demands of the profound problems of the present day.” Roe, 410 U. S., at 165. These are precisely the sort of considerations that legislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that accommodate competing interests. The scheme Roe produced looked like legislation, and the Court provided the sort of explanation that might be expected from a legislative body. An even more glaring deficiency was Roe’s failure to justify the critical distinction it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions. See id., at 163. The arbitrary viability line, which Casey termed Roe’s central rule, has not found much support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted to justify a right to abortion. The most obvious 6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\n",
            "Syllabus\n",
            "argument is that viability has changed over time and is heavily dependent on factors—such as medical advances and the availability of quality medical care—that have nothing to do with the characteristics of a fetus.\n",
            "When Casey revisited Roe almost 20 years later, it reaffirmed Roe’s central holding, but pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its reasoning. The Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. 505 U. S., at 846. The controlling opinion criticized and rejected Roe’s trimester scheme, 505 U. S., at 872, and substituted a new and obscure “undue burden” test. Casey, in short, either refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roe’s analysis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roe’s reasoning, endorsed what it termed Roe’s central holding while suggesting that a majority might not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the abortion right other than Roe’s status as precedent, and imposed a new test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent. Pp. 45–56.\n",
            "(3) Workability. Deciding whether a precedent should be overruled depends in part on whether the rule it imposes is workable—that is, whether it can be understood and applied in a consistent and predictable manner. Casey’s “undue burden” test has scored poorly on the workability scale. The Casey plurality tried to put meaning into the “undue burden” test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these rules created their own problems. And the difficulty of applying Casey’s new rules surfaced in that very case. Compare 505 U. S., at 881–887, with id., at 920–922 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The experience of the Courts of Appeals provides further evidence that Casey’s “line between” permissible and unconstitutional restrictions “has proved to be impossible to draw with precision.” Janus, 585 U. S., at ___. Casey has generated a long list of Circuit conflicts. Continued adherence to Casey’s unworkable “undue burden” test would undermine, not advance, the “evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles.” Payne, 501 U. S., at 827. Pp. 56–62.\n",
            "(4) Effect on other areas of law. Roe and Casey have led to the distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines, and that effect provides further support for overruling those decisions. See Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (K AVANAUGH, J., concurring in part). Pp. 62–63.\n",
            "(5) Reliance interests. Overruling Roe and Casey will not upend concrete reliance interests like those that develop in “cases involving property and contract rights.” Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. In Casey, the controlling opinion conceded that traditional reliance interests were not implicated because getting an abortion is generally “unplanned activity,” and “reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions.” 505 U. S., at 856. Instead, the opinion perceived a more intangible form of reliance, namely, that “people [had] organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society . . . in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail” and that “[t]he ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.” Ibid. The contending sides in this case make impassioned and conflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right on the lives of women as well as the status of the fetus. The Casey plurality’s speculative attempt to weigh the relative importance of the interests of the fetus and the mother represent a departure from the “original constitutional proposition” that “courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.” Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 729–730.\n",
            "The Solicitor General suggests that overruling Roe and Casey would threaten the protection of other rights under the Due Process Clause. The Court emphasizes that this decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. Pp. 63–66.\n",
            "(c) Casey identified another concern, namely, the danger that the public will perceive a decision overruling a controversial “watershed” decision, such as Roe, as influenced by political considerations or public opinion. 505 U. S., at 866–867. But the Court cannot allow its decisions to be affected by such extraneous concerns. A precedent of this Court is subject to the usual principles of stare decisis under which adherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command. If the rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy would still be the law. The Court’s job is to interpret the law, apply longstanding principles of stare decisis, and decide this case accordingly. Pp. 66–69.\n",
            "(d) Under the Court’s precedents, rational-basis review is the appropriate standard to apply when state abortion regulations undergo constitutional challenge. Given that procuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional right, it follows that the States may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are challenged under the Constitution, courts cannot “substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.” Ferguson, 372 U. S., at 729–730. That applies even when the laws at issue concern matters of great social significance and moral substance. A law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is entitled to a “strong presumption of validity.” Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319. It must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests. Id., at 320.\n",
            "Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act is supported by the Mississippi Legislature’s specific findings, which include the State’s asserted interest in “protecting the life of the unborn.” §2(b)(i). These legitimate interests provide a rational basis for the Gestational Age Act, and it follows that respondents’ constitutional challenge must fail. Pp. 76–78.\n",
            "(e) Abortion presents a profound moral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. The Court overrules those decisions and returns that authority to the people and their elected representatives. Pp. 78–79.\n",

The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents and permanently enjoined enforcement of the Act, reasoning that Mississippi’s 15-week restriction on abortion violates this Court’s cases forbidding States to ban abortion pre-viability. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. Before this Court, petitioners defend the Act on the grounds that Roe and Casey were wrongly decided and that the Act is constitutional because it satisfies rational-basis review. Held: The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives. Pp. 8–79. (a) The critical question is whether the Constitution, properly understood, confers a right to obtain an abortion. Casey’s controlling opinion skipped over that question and reaffirmed Roe solely on the basis of stare decisis. A proper application of stare decisis, however, requires an assessment of the strength of the grounds on which Roe was based. The Court therefore turns to the question that the Casey plurality did not consider. Pp. 8–32. (1) First, the Court reviews the standard that the Court’s cases have used to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment’s reference to “liberty” protects a particular right. The Constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion, but several constitutional provisions have been offered as potential homes for an implicit constitutional right. Roe held that the abortion right is part of a right to privacy that springs from the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. See 410 U. S., at 152–153. The Casey Court grounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an abortion is part of the “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. Others have suggested that support can be found in the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, but that theory is squarely foreclosed by the Court’s precedents, which establish that a State’s regulation of abortion is not a sex-based classification and is thus not subject to the heightened scrutiny that applies to such classifications. See Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U. S. 484, 496, n. 20; Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U. S. 263, 273-274. Rather, regulations and prohibitions of abortion are governed by the same standard of review as other health and safety measures. Pp. 9–11. (2) Next, the Court examines whether the right to obtain an abortion is rooted in the Nation’s history and tradition and whether it is an essential component of “ordered liberty.” The Court finds that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and tradition. The underlying theory on which Casey rested—that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for “liberty”—has long been controversial. The Court’s decisions have held that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of substantive rights—those rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments to the Constitution and those rights deemed fundamental that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the question is whether the right is “deeply rooted in [our] history and tradition” and whether it is essential to this Nation’s “scheme of ordered liberty.” Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (internal quotation marks omitted). The term “liberty” alone provides little guidance. Thus, historical inquiries are essential whenever the Court is asked to recognize a new component of the “liberty” interest protected by the Due Process Clause. In interpreting what is meant by “liberty,” the Court must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse what the Fourteenth Amendment protects with the Court’s own ardent views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. For this reason, the Court has been “reluctant” to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution. Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125. Guided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of the Nation’s concept of ordered liberty, the Court finds the Fourteenth Amendment clearly does not protect the right to an abortion. Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years before Roe, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor had any scholarly treatise. Indeed, abortion had long been a crime in every single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy. This consensus endured until the day Roe was decided. Roe either ignored or misstated this history, and Casey declined to reconsider Roe’s faulty historical analysis. Respondents’ argument that this history does not matter flies in the face of the standard the Court has applied in determining whether an asserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is nevertheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Solicitor General repeats Roe’s claim that it is “doubtful . . . abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the  5 Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) Syllabus discussed below weigh strongly in favor of overruling Roe and Casey. Pp. 39–66. (1) The nature of the Court’s error. Like the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided. Casey perpetuated its errors, calling both sides of the national controversy to resolve their debate, but in doing so, Casey necessarily declared a winning side. Those on the losing side—those who sought to advance the State’s interest in fetal life—could no longer seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views. The Court short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who disagreed with Roe. Pp. 43–45. (2) The quality of the reasoning. Without any grounding in the constitutional text, history, or precedent, Roe imposed on the entire country a detailed set of rules for pregnancy divided into trimesters much like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation. See 410 U. S., at 163–164. Roe’s failure even to note the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said about the common law was simply wrong. Then, after surveying history, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee, and did not explain why the sources on which it relied shed light on the meaning of the Constitution. As to precedent, citing a broad array of cases, the Court found support for a constitutional “right of personal privacy.” Id., at 152. But Roe conflated the right to shield information from disclosure and the right to make and implement important personal decisions without governmental interference. See Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599–600. None of these decisions involved what is distinctive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed “potential life.” When the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on the country, it asserted that its rules were “consistent with,” among other things, “the relative weights of the respective interests involved” and “the demands of the profound problems of the present day.” Roe, 410 U. S., at 165. These are precisely the sort of considerations that legislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that accommodate competing interests. The scheme Roe produced looked like legislation, and the Court provided the sort of explanation that might be expected from a legislative body. An even more glaring deficiency was Roe’s failure to justify the critical distinction it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions. See id., at 163. The arbitrary viability line, which Casey termed Roe’s central rule, has not found much support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted to justify a right to abortion. The most obvious 6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION Syllabus argument is that viability has changed over time and is heavily dependent on factors—such as medical advances and the availability of quality medical care—that have nothing to do with the characteristics of a fetus. When Casey revisited Roe almost 20 years later, it reaffirmed Roe’s central holding, but pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its reasoning. The Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. 505 U. S., at 846. The controlling opinion criticized and rejected Roe’s trimester scheme, 505 U. S., at 872, and substituted a new and obscure “undue burden” test. Casey, in short, either refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roe’s analysis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roe’s reasoning, endorsed what it termed Roe’s central holding while suggesting that a majority might not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the abortion right other than Roe’s status as precedent, and imposed a new test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent. Pp. 45–56. (3) Workability. Deciding whether a precedent should be overruled depends in part on whether the rule it imposes is workable—that is, whether it can be understood and applied in a consistent and predictable manner. Casey’s “undue burden” test has scored poorly on the workability scale. The Casey plurality tried to put meaning into the “undue burden” test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these rules created their own problems. And the difficulty of applying Casey’s new rules surfaced in that very case. Compare 505 U. S., at 881–887, with id., at 920–922 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The experience of the Courts of Appeals provides further evidence that Casey’s “line between” permissible and unconstitutional restrictions “has proved to be impossible to draw with precision.” Janus, 585 U. S., at ___. Casey has generated a long list of Circuit conflicts. Continued adherence to Casey’s unworkable “undue burden” test would undermine, not advance, the “evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles.” Payne, 501 U. S., at 827. Pp. 56–62. (4) Effect on other areas of law. Roe and Casey have led to the distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines, and that effect provides further support for overruling those decisions. See Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (K AVANAUGH, J., concurring in part). Pp. 62–63. (5) Reliance interests. Overruling Roe and Casey will not upend concrete reliance interests like those that develop in “cases involving property and contract rights.” Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. In Casey, the controlling opinion conceded that traditional reliance interests were not implicated because getting an abortion is generally “unplanned activity,” and “reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions.” 505 U. S., at 856. Instead, the opinion perceived a more intangible form of reliance, namely, that “people [had] organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society . . . in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail” and that “[t]he ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.” Ibid. The contending sides in this case make impassioned and conflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right on the lives of women as well as the status of the fetus. The Casey plurality’s speculative attempt to weigh the relative importance of the interests of the fetus and the mother represent a departure from the “original constitutional proposition” that “courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.” Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 729–730. The Solicitor General suggests that overruling Roe and Casey would threaten the protection of other rights under the Due Process Clause. The Court emphasizes that this decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. Pp. 63–66. (c) Casey identified another concern, namely, the danger that the public will perceive a decision overruling a controversial “watershed” decision, such as Roe, as influenced by political considerations or public opinion. 505 U. S., at 866–867. But the Court cannot allow its decisions to be affected by such extraneous concerns. A precedent of this Court is subject to the usual principles of stare decisis under which adherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command. If the rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy would still be the law. The Court’s job is to interpret the law, apply longstanding principles of stare decisis, and decide this case accordingly. Pp. 66–69. (d) Under the Court’s precedents, rational-basis review is the appropriate standard to apply when state abortion regulations undergo constitutional challenge. Given that procuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional right, it follows that the States may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are challenged under the Constitution, courts cannot “substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.” Ferguson, 372 U. S., at 729–730. That applies even when the laws at issue concern matters of great social significance and moral substance. A law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is entitled to a “strong presumption of validity.” Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319. It must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests. Id., at 320. Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act is supported by the Mississippi Legislature’s specific findings, which include the State’s asserted interest in “protecting the life of the unborn.” §2(b)(i). These legitimate interests provide a rational basis for the Gestational Age Act, and it follows that respondents’ constitutional challenge must fail. Pp. 76–78. (e) Abortion presents a profound moral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. The Court overrules those decisions and returns that authority to the people and their elected representatives. Pp. 78–79. 945 F. 3d 265, reversed and remanded.

Argued December 1, 2021—Decided June 24, 2022 Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act provides that “[e]xcept in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality, a person shall not intentionally or knowingly perform... or induce an abortion of an unborn human being if the probable gestational age of the unborn human being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15) weeks.” Miss.

In interpreting what is meant by “liberty,” the Court must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse what the Fourteenth Amendment protects with the Court’s own ardent views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. For this reason, 3 Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) Syllabus the Court has been “reluctant” to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution. Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125. Guided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of the Nation’s concept of ordered liberty, the Court finds the Fourteenth Amendment clearly does not protect the right to an abortion. Until the latter part of the 20t h century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years before Roe, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor had any scholarly treatise. Indeed, abortion had long been a crime in every single State. At common la w, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy. This consensus endured until the day Roe was decided. Roe either ignored or misstated this history, and Casey declined to reconsider Roe’s faulty historical analysis. Respondents’ argument that this history does not matter flies in the face of the standard the Court has applied in determining whether an asserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is nevertheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Solicitor General repeats Roe’s claim that it is “doubtful... abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus,” 410 U. S., at 136, but the great common-law authorities—Bracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstone—all wrote that a post- quickening abortion was a crime. Moreover, many authorities asserted that even a pre-quickening abortion was “unlawful” and that, as a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from the attempt. The Solicitor General suggests that history supports an abortion right because of the common law’s failure to criminalize abortion before quickening, but the insistence on quickening was not universal, see Mills v. Commonwealth, 13 Pa. 631, 633; State v. Slagle, 83 N. C. 630, 632, and regardless, the fact that many States in the late 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-quickening abortions does not mean that anyone thought the States lacked the authority to do so. Instead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right itself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Casey contend that the abortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right. Roe termed this a right to privacy, 410 U. S., at 154, and Casey described it as the freedom to make “intimate and personal choices” that are “central to personal dignity and autonomy,” 505 U. S., at 851. Ordered 4 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION Syllabus liberty sets limits and defines the boundary between competing interests. Roe and Casey each struck a particular balance between the interests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interests of what they termed “potential life.” Roe, 410 U. S., at 150; Casey, 505 U. S., at 852. But the people of the various States may evaluate those interests differently. The Nation’s historical understanding of ordered liberty does not prevent the people’s elected representatives from deciding how abortion should be regulated. Pp. 11–30. (3) Finally, the Court considers whether a right to obtain an abortion is part of a broader entrenched right that is supported by other precedents. The Court concludes the right to obtain an abortion cannot be justified as a component of such a right. Attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one’s “concept of existence” prove too much. Casey, 505 U. S., at 851. Those criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like. What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion is different because it destroys what Roe termed “potential life” and what the law challenged in this case calls an “unborn human being.” None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. Accordingly, those cases do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and the Court’s conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way. Pp. 30–32. (b) The doctrine of stare decisis does not counsel continued acceptance of Roe and Casey. Stare decisis plays an important role and protects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a past decision. It “reduces incentives for challenging settled precedents, saving parties and courts the expense of endless re-litigation.” Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 455. It “contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827. And it restrains judicial hubris by respecting the judgment of those who grappled with important questions in the past. But stare decisis is not an inexorable command, Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 233, and “is at its weakest when [the Court] interpret[s] the Constitution,” Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 235. Some of the Court’s most important constitutional decisions have overruled prior precedents. See, e.g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 491 (overruling the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, and its progeny).  The Court’s cases have identified factors that should be considered in deciding when a precedent should be overruled. Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees, 585 U. S. ___, ___–___. Five factors      5 Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) Syllabus discussed below weigh strongly in favor of overruling Roe and Casey. Pp. 39–66. (1) The nature of the Court’s error. Like the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided. Casey perpetuated its errors, calling both sides of the national controversy to resolve their debate, but in doing so, Casey necessarily declared a winning side. Those on the losing side—those who sought to advance the State’s interest in fetal life—could no longer seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views. The Court short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who disagreed with Roe. Pp. 43–45. (2) The quality of the reasoning. Without any grounding in the constitutional text, hi story, or precedent, Roe imposed on the entire country a detailed set of rules for pregnancy divided into trimesters much like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation. See 410 U. S., at 163–164. Roe’s failure even to note the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said about the common law was simply wrong. Then, after surveying history, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee, and did not explain why the source s on which it relied shed light on the meaning of the Constitution. As to precedent, citing a broad array of cases, the Court found support for a constitutional “right of personal privacy.” Id., at 152. But Roe conflated the right to shield information from disclosure and the right to make and implement important personal decisions without governmental interference. See Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599–600. None of these decisions involved what is distinctive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed “potential life.” When the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on the country, it asserted that its rules were “consistent with,” among other things, “the relative weights of the respective interests involved” and “the demands of the profound problems of the present day.” Roe, 410 U. S., at 165. These are precisely the sort of considerations that legislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that accommodate competing interests. The scheme Roe produced looked like legislation, and the Court provided the sort of explanation that might be expected from a legislative body. An even more glaring deficiency was Roe’s failure to justify the critical distinction it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions. See id., at 163. The arbitrary viability line, which Casey termed Roe’s central rule, has not found much support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted to justify a right to abortion. The most obvious problem with any such       6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION Syllabus argument is that viability has changed over time and is heavily dependent on factors—such as medica l advances and the availability of quality medical care—that have nothing to do with the characteristics of a fetus. When Casey revisited Roe almost 20 years later, it reaffirmed Roe’s central holding, but pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its reasoning. The Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. 505 U. S., at 846. The controlling opinion criticized and rejected Roe’s trimester scheme, 505 U. S., at 872, and substituted a new and obscure “undue burden” test. Casey, in short, either refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roe’s analysis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roe’s reasoning, endorsed what it termed Roe’s central holding while suggesting that a majority might not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the abortion right other than Roe’s status as precedent, and imposed a new test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent. Pp. 45–56. (3) Workability. Deciding whether a precedent should be overruled depends in part on whether the rule it imposes is workable—that is, whether it can be understood an d applied in a consistent and predictable manner. Casey’s “undue burden” test ha s scored poorly on the workability scale. The Casey plurality tried to put meaning into the “undue burden” test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these rules created their own problems. And the difficulty of applying Casey’s new rules surfaced in that very case. Compare 505 U. S., at 881– 887, with id., at 920–922 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The experience of the Courts of Appeals provides further evidence that Casey’s “line between” permissible and unconstitutional restrictions “has proved to be impossible to draw with precision.” Janus, 585 U. S., at ___. Casey has generated a long list of Circuit conflicts. Continued adherence to Casey’s unworkable “undue burden” test would undermine, not advance, the “evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles.” Payne, 501 U. S., at 827. Pp. 56–62. (4) Effect on other areas of law. Roe and Casey have led to the distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines, and that effect provides further support for overruling those decisions. See Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (K AVANAUGH, J., concurring in part). Pp. 62–63. (5) Reliance interests. Overruling Roe and Casey will not upend concrete reliance interests like those that develop in “cases involving property and contract rights.” Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. In Casey, the controlling opinion conceded that traditional reliance interests were    7 Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) Syllabus not implicated because getting an abortion is generally “unplanned activity,” and “reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions.” 505 U. S., at 856. Instead, the opinion perceived a more intangible form of reliance, namely, that “people [had] organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society... in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail” and that “[t]he ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.” Ibid. The contending sides in this case make impassioned and conflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right on the lives of women as well as the status of the fetus. The Casey plurality’s speculative attempt to weigh the relative importance of the interests of the fetus and the mother represent a departure from the “original constitutional proposition” that “courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.” Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 729–730. The Solicitor General suggests that overruling Roe and Casey would threaten the protection of other rights under the Due Process Clause. The Court emphasizes that this decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. Pp. 63–66. (c) Casey identified another concern, namely, the danger that the public will perceive a decision overruling a controversial “watershed” decision, such as Roe, as influenced by political considerations or public opinion. 505 U. S., at 866–867. But the Court cannot allow its decisions to be affected by such extraneous concerns. A precedent of this Court is subject to the usual principles of stare decisis under which adherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command. If the rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy would still be the law. The Court’s job is to interpret the law, apply longstanding principles of stare decisis, and decide this case accordingly. Pp. 66–69. (d)Under the Court’s precedents, rational-basis review is the appropriate standard to apply when state abortion regulations undergo constitutional challenge. Given that procuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional right, it follows that the States may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are challenged under the Constitution, courts cannot “substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.” Ferguson, 372 U. S., at 729–730. That applies even when the laws at issue concern matters of great social significance and moral substance. A law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is entitled to a 8 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION Syllabus “strong presumption of validity.” Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319. It must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests. Id., at 320. Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act is supported by the Mississippi Legislature’s specific findings, which include the State’s asserted interest in “protecting the life of the unborn.” §2(b)(i). These legitimate interests provide a rational basis for the Gestational Age Act, and it follows that respondents’ constitutional challenge must fail. Pp. 76– 78. (e)Abortion presents a profound moral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. The Court overrules those decisions and returns that authority to the people and their elected representatives. Pp. 78–79. 945 F. 3d 265, reversed and remanded. ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which T HOMAS, GORSUCH, K AVANAUGH, and B ARRETT, JJ., joined. T HOMAS, J., and K AVANAUGH, J., filed concurring opinions. R OBERTS, C. J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. B REYER, SOTOMAYOR, and K AGAN, JJ., filed a dissenting opinion.\n"

        "Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act provides that “[e]xcept in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality, a person shall not intentionally or knowingly perform... or induce an abortion of an unborn human being if the probable gestational age of the unborn human being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15) weeks.” Miss. Code Ann. §41–41–191. Respondents—Jackson Women’s Health Organization, an abortion clinic, and one of its doctors—challenged the Act in Federal District Court, alleging that it violated this Court’s precedents establishing a constitutional right to abortion, in particular Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents and permanently enjoined enforcement of the Act, reasoning that Mississippi’s 15-week restriction on abortion violates this Court’s cases forbidding States to ban abortion pre-viability. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. Before this Court, petitioners defend the Act on the grounds that Roe and Casey were wrongly decided and that the Act is constitutional because it satisfies rational-basis review. Held: The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives.\n",

              "\"Mississippi's Gestational Age Act prohibits abortions of unborn human beings if their probable gestational age is greater than 15 weeks, except in cases of a medical emergency or severe fetal abnormality. The Act was challenged in court by the Jackson Women’s Health Organization and a doctor, arguing that it violated constitutional rights to abortion established in prior Supreme Court cases, including Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that there is no constitutional right to abortion, overturning Roe and Casey and returning the authority to regulate abortion to the states and their elected representatives. The decision emphasized that the right to obtain an abortion is not deeply rooted in the country's history and tradition and can be subject to state regulations under rational-basis review. The Court also considered the workability and effect on other legal doctrines in its decision to overrule Roe and Casey and highlighted the moral question surrounding abortion. The decision was issued by Justice Alito, joined by Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, with Chief Justice Roberts concurring in the judgment, and Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan dissenting.\""

Reproductive health care services refer to abortion services; contraceptive services; in vitro fertilization; or other reproductive care, education, and counseling that is provided at a health care site or via telehealth, and in a medically accurate manner. The bill prohibits individuals, entities, and states from preventing, restricting, or otherwise interfering with the provision of lawful reproductive health care services by health care providers. The Department of Justice, individuals, or providers may bring a lawsuit to enforce this bill, and states are not immune from suits for violations. Furthermore, states may not use federal funds to pursue legal cases or similar proceedings (e.g., adverse licensing proceedings) against health care providers, individuals, or entities that offer or assist with lawful reproductive health care services. Additionally, medical malpractice insurers may not deny coverage to or sue a health care provider because the provider offers or assists with lawful reproductive health care services. The bill also funds grants to assist health care providers who offer or refer for abortion services and face legal issues relating to their provision of reproductive health care services with legal matters and improving security.\n"

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the Abortion is Health Care Everywhere Act of 2021''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: Abortion is a critical component of sexual and reproductive health care and should be accessible and affordable for all people. All people have the right to make their own choices about their sexual and reproductive health, and to access quality and affordable sexual and reproductive health care. International agreements have recognized reproductive rights for over 25 years, and the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals reiterated the centrality of reproductive rights to gender equality. Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that when people, including young women and adolescent girls, gender non conforming individuals, and transgender men, are able to control their reproductive lives, there are enormous social and economic benefits not just for the individual and their family, but for entire communities. Countries that prioritize reproductive health, rights, and justice and human rights are more likely to have better overall health throughout. Health system cost is reduced when abortion is widely available and integrated with other types of health care. Without access to safe abortion care, people risk their lives to end their pregnancies. At least 24,100 people in low and middle income countries die every year from complications from unsafe abortion. Ninety seven percent of unsafe abortions occur in developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In low and middle income countries, the annual cost of post abortion care for all who need it would be 4 billion. The majority of this cost is attributed to treating complications from abortions provided in unsafe conditions. Restricting abortion does not reduce either the need for or number of abortions. Abortion rates are similar in countries where it is highly restricted by law and where it is broadly legal. When abortions are performed in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and standards, there is minimal risk of severe complications or death. As part of their commitment to prevent unsafe abortions and preventable deaths and ensure all people have access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care and can exercise their right to full control over their sexuality and reproduction, developing countries and donor governments must work collaboratively to deploy funding, align policies, and mobilize expertise to make safe abortion services available to those seeking to terminate pregnancies. United States law restricting United States foreign assistance funding from being used to provide safe abortion services has the effect of harming people who seek to terminate their pregnancies in several ways, including by blocking access to services and erecting barriers to providers obtaining the training and equipment needed to deliver care to those in need. Since section 104(f) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b(f)) (commonly referred to as the Helms amendment'') was enacted in 1973, dozens of governments across the globe have liberalized abortion laws and policies. In countries where the United States supports family planning and reproductive health care and in which abortion is legal on at least some grounds, support for safe abortion could avert over 19 million unsafe abortions and 17,000 maternal deaths each year. SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. The following shall be the policy of the United States Government: Safe abortion is a critical component of comprehensive maternal and reproductive health care and should be included as part of foreign assistance programs funded by the United States Government. Safe abortion is to be made widely available and integrated with other types of health care. The United States Government should work to end unsafe abortion and promote safe abortion services by providing funding and collaborating with affected governments and service providers to provide training, commodities and equipment, and access to safe abortion services. SEC. 4. USE OF FUNDS FOR COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. Section 104 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b) is amended in subsection (f) (A) by striking paragraph ; and (B) by redesignating paragraphs and as paragraphs and , respectively; by redesignating subsection (g) as subsection (h); and by inserting after subsection (f), as amended, the following: (g) Use of Funds for Comprehensive Reproductive Health Care Services. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, funds made available to carry out this part may be used to provide comprehensive reproductive health care services, including abortion services, training, and equipment.''.\""

        "The quality of the generated legislaiton definitely depends on the input and could benefit from training examples. The legislation created by converted the anti-abortion bill to a pro-abortion bill read as an actual piece of congressional legislation with no problem. However, the legislation created by converting the pro-abortion bill to an anti-abortion one simply added \"not\" or \"no\" to many of the original sentences, which technically did change the type of legislation but also resulted in silly assertions where the evaluation model still clocked it as pro-abortion."
