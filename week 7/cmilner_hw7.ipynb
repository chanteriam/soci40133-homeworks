    "# Week 7 - Prediction & Causal Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we explored (supervised) text classification, where we train a model to learn associations between text and some classification or value connected with it (e.g., what distinguishes a winning argument before the Supreme Court; can we extend our judgment regarding what documents are relevant to my thesis project to all of Google News; etc.) Classification often uses a representative sample of text about which we want to make inferences and then we use machine learning to learn \"true\" assignments and classify the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we explore two different types of inferences to out-of-sample populations. _Prediction_ involves our reasoned expectation regarding an unobserved state of the world, given the world in which we live and on which we have trained our prediction algorithm. Often this prediction is about the future world. We don't expect the U.S. Congress to talk about the identical things today and tomorrow, but today should contain some useful information. by contrast _causal inference_ poses the related by distinct challenge of our reasoned expectations regarding an unobserved state of the world IF we intervene in some way. In other words, what does the intervention cause, and how can we predict it to change the world. Causality has a deeply contested history in social science and philosophy, but it usually involves an \"if,\" a difference between two counterfactual worlds, one where an event occurs and one where it doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal questions in text analysis may place the text in one or more of many positions we explore below: as cause, effect, confounder, mediator (or moderator), or collider. For example, assuming that everything spoken can be transcribed into text, saying something mean might hurt someone's feelings (text as cause). Doing something mean might cause someone to say something angry (text as effect). Apologizing might change the influence of doing something mean (text as mediator/moderator). A compliment might obscure the effect of doing something mean (text as confounder). And yelling something audaciously mean might yield a loud, emotional response, which both influence the likelihood that the interaction was recorded and subjected to analysis (text as collider). As you can see, in a single conversation, text can play all of these roles. Why do we care about cause and effect with text? Because while words appear to exert power in the world, which words spoken under what circumstances by whom? Causal analysis attempts to get at the question, if _X_ was written or spoken, _Y_ would happen."

    "\n",
    "SCOTUS opinions often include novel arguments for or against a given social issue. In the 1973 *Roe v. Wade* case, SCOTUS argued for the constitutional right to abortion based on the concept of privacy, an argument that had not been made before. Conversely, the 2022 *Dobbs v Jackson* opinion made the case against a constitutional right to abortion based on the lack of constitutional precedent for the practice. It is reasonable to assume that these novel arguments will influence the way congressional legislation following the opinions frames pro- or anti-abortion policies. Additionally, the way that the media covers abortion access across the US will begin to adopt these arguments, and even more, the outcome of arguments could cause a rise in counter-argumentative media articles (e.g., after *Roe*, an increased presence of anti-abortion media coverage). To assess the first prediction, we could use SCOTUS opinions as bookmarks in time, and assses the language used in the subsequent congressional legislation up to the next major SCOTUS opinion. With this, we can extract and weight key terms (nouns, adverbs, etc.) in the scotus case, and use these key terms to predict the type of congressional legislation to follow based on their own key terms and phrases. For the second article, we can adopt a similar model using media articles instead of congressional legislation."

Based on the data above, it has a significant effect (p <.001) on whether the second response agrees. Though it does have a significant effect, it does not account for much of the variation in agreement_r2, based on the Adjusted R-squared value (0.012), with the value of fact-feeling_unsure_r1 only accounting for 1.2% of the variation in agreement_r2."

We think the length of the first response would improve how much the variation in the data was explained by our model ($R^2$).

    "This research article introduces a method to understand the causal impact of certain features in text documents, such as the inclusion of a theorem in a paper or mentioning an author's gender in a post, on outcomes like paper acceptance or post popularity. It tackles the problem of texts being too complex and high-dimensional for traditional causal inference methods by developing \"causally sufficient embeddings\". These are low-dimensional representations of documents that maintain crucial information for identifying causal effects while disregarding irrelevant details. The method combines language modeling techniques with supervised dimensionality reduction, focusing only on text aspects predictive of both the intervention (like adding a theorem) and the outcome (such as paper acceptance). The approach is validated through semi-synthetic datasets, showing improvements in causal estimation, and the article discusses potential future improvements and the challenges in assessing the assumptions behind these black box models."
